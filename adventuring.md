I joined the hash house harriers on their annual tubing hash camp weekend.


# Friday 
bike 40 miles to traders campgrounds in Arena, Wi. Site is located near the tubing start off the wisconsin river

I rode with my friends Lara and Clint. We met off the bike path near the hospital. It had been a somewhat crazy morning. A person got arrested just in front of my building. 

The ride itself was pretty good. It rained, but very lightly. We all were anticipating rain and had no problem keeping things dry. The sun popped out on ocassion and had some relaxing beer breaks in a cross plains church playground, RJs bar in mazomanie and a trailer yard 6 miles short of traders campgrounds.

# Saturday
I woke up early and biked to spring green. I had pancakes and yogurt at Break of Dawn restaurant. I then rode back to find most peoples awake. We played frisby and did a short trail run. 

We then headed to the wisconsin river where we went tubing. It took about 5 hours and swam quite a bit and spent time hanging out enjoying the sun. 
We took breaks on sand bars and would have drinks.

Once back at  the campsite, we grilled out, played frisbee and played board games.

# Sunday
I once again woke up early and enjoyed a tex mex omolette at Break of Dawn restaurant. I spent two hours reading and then headed back around 8pm.
