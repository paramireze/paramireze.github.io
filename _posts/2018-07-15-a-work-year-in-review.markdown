It is my favorite time of year again. I am up for my annual performane review. My supervisors and co-workers will be anonymously submitting their evaluations of my performance. Funny part is, I helped write the software they are submitting their evaluations in ;)

I have never heard of an easy job, and mine is no exception. I am the senior developer in our four person development team. All those that came before me have moved on. It is my turn to take on the nights watch.

`Night Gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children."

For this post, I will be going over each major project I worked on for the last year. My goal is to reminiscent over the past year while drinking a sour ale at my favorite bar. 

## My background
I am a software developer for the Department of Radiology at the School of Medicine and Public Health. My job description requires that I spent up to 70% of my time working on software development. 

## Exam Q&A
Radiologists are like mushrooms. They are kept in the dark and fed shit ;). Sorry, I had to quote one of my favorite movies. I blame the Infectious Groove beer I am drinking. When a radiologist is looking at an image, they can optionally leave feedback about the qualityof the image they are looking at. There are times when a technologist will do a good or bad job of scanning body parts and the Exam QA allows Radiologists to communicate their feedback as to their scan quality. 

The `Exam QA` itself is a crud application that takes parameters being passed in from the `Picture Archiving Communication System (PACS)`.
