For my pro-bono project building a simple calculator app, I put together a basic interface that has two input boxes and some labels.
I created `IBOutputs` and `IBActions` for the form fields and added some basic logic to make sure everything is hooked together properly.

I find myself giddy now that I am off in the wild programming all on my own without the help of tutorials. 
My next step will be data validation and polishing up the interface.
