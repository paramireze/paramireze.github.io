I had to go back and rewatch a few tutorial videos on iOS development. Learning iOS development has proven to be so much different than anything I have done before that I am not able to figure things out as I go. Instead, I went back and really made sure that I knew how to use `autolayout`, `ibaction`, `iboutput`, and basic `xcode ide` controls and functionality. I was able to somewhat skate by doing android development since a) `android studio` is similar to `intellij` which I know my way around well. b) android uses java which I don't know too well, however, I have worked with in the past and can usually figure things out comfortably. 

Learning the `XCode` ide has proven to be the biggest challenge for me so far. I have realized that I worked almost excusively with `intelliJ`. Secondly, having a graphical interface for laying out the gui and creating event handlers for those gui elements is new to me also. In the last two weeks, I have spent myself almost exclusively working on the concepts I have mentioned. I am just now feel comfortable enough to write this post saying I feel comfortable enough.
