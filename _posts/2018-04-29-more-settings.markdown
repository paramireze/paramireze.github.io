In this lesson, I completed the preference selection page by adding additional checkboxes and a pop up selection list. The Exercise had me create a file to store array strings that would later be used as label and values for the user to select from.

I like to diagram things when I have a hard time understanding how things are communicating. Creating this workflow diagram helped me understand how the layouts and activities are interacting with one another.
