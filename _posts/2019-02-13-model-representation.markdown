For the first series of tutorials, I learned what it means to use `Supervised Learning`. Supervised learning tries to answer the question `How does the input relate to the output?`. Essentially, supervised learning is a strategy for creating a function that can provide accurate outputs based on former experience (e.g. training sets of data). 

## Gradient Descent

Gradient Descent is a first order iterative algorithm used to find the local minimum. It is a method for minimizing the cost function to arrive at the local minimum

## Cost Function

The cost function is used to measure the accuracy of an hypothesis, using the results of the hypothesis. The cost function is a function of `theta one`.

The cost function is the sum of all squared height values for each point on the x-axis
