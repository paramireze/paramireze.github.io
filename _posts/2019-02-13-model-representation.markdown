In the latest series of video's and readings, the instructor discusses linear regression & model representation.

We are able to use model representation to represent the datasets being used to populate a linear graph.

The convention is to use `x` to represent inputs.

Use `y` to represent outputs.

and `h`, the hypothesis, is represents the mapping between the two.

knowing `h` will predict the high level of certainty of `y` when providing `x`.

The superscript `(i)` is an index to reference a specific data input.

The combination of (x, y) is considered to be a dataset.
