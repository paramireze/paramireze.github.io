Hey, I am writing about something other than the inner workings of an IT team. That must mean that I am writing code again. It is true, I am writing code. These days I am writing Java for android. I don't know much about Java, however, I find that I am able to learn quickly. The reason being is I am use to reading java error messages. You know that ugly stacktrace that looks like lorem ipsum. I guess, a lot of programming is just knowing what the problems are. If you know that you can easily google your solutions. Good job Paul !
