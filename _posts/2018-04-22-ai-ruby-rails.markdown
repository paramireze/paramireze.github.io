It has been a while since I have touched Ruby Rails. There was a time when I was fervently building a rails app any chance I got. 

Work has taken on a development platform using Ruby Rails. There are differences that I will have to learn because they are not using the latest versions or thedefault technologies such as puma and dbmigrations.

# SDK query Library

AI recommends that all queries are done through the `SDK query library`. This will help prevent things from making if there are changes to the model.

# Universal Event Type

`Universal Event type` is a standard used to indicate a status of an exam. Each location might have different statuses specific to their location which is why the `universal event type` is useful. AI requires that statuses are tracked through `the Universal Event Type` for distribution.

# Filters
Wow, it has been a long time. I have forgotton what filters do exactly. according to the ruby rails docs, `Filters` are methods that are run `before`, `after` or `around` a controller action. `before` filters are most commonly used with authentication/authorization.
