![Monthly Expenses]({{ '/assets/images/2019/march/expenses.png' }})

At the end of January, I decided to see how much I could reduce my spending. Considering, my expenses are already low, it was a matter of refraining from going out to restaurants and avoid needless shopping. 

# results

After calculating my expenses and reimbursements for splitting rent/gas/electric and my mom's cigarettes, my total spending were **1478.99**. I was able to reduce my spending by $1500 from last month.

# what I did right
I communicated with friends and family that I will be focusing on my self and my career. That allowed me to more easily decline invitations to go out. 

# what I could have done to improve
The thing that cost me the most is stress. When I am stress, my eating and drinking habits change a lot and I will often be more impulsive about my purchases. In the future, I will need to identify stresses sooner so to avoid those needless spendings.

## Frugal doesn't mean you can't find quality stuff 

# food 
 
Lots and lots of veggies with every meal.
