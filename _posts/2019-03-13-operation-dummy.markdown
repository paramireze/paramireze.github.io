Last December, I woke up to a missing cargo bike. It was locked to my patio and would remain missing for several months. It is a long tailed, fat cargo bike (say that 10x fast).

Several months later, I received a call from a guy named Nate. He had found my bike abandoned between some buildings close to where I live. That tells me I likely had forgotton to lock it and someone took for a joy ride. 

Well, this dummy was reunited with his other dummy. It had been sitting out in the snow and rain for the last few months and some TLC was required

# go on gnarly ride

The plan was to destroy my quads by biking the militery ridge bike path to Mt. Horeb.

Hung out at Grumpy troll for a drink and a growler fill at the turn-around.

# embrace the slop

The ride home was much more difficult than the ride there, despite the descent in elevation. Fortunately, I was insightful enough to fill up a couple of growlers for the ride home.

# mission complete

After 7 hours of riding, I was thoroughly reacquainted with my beloved dummy.
