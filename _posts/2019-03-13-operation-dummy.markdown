Last December, I woke up to a missing cargo bike. It was locked to my patio and would remain missing for several months. It is a long tailed, fat cargo bike (say that 10x fast).

Several months later, I received a call from a guy named Nate. He had found my bike abandoned between some buildings close to where I live. That tells me I likely had forgotton to lock it and someone took for a joy ride. 

The bike was had some rust on it but otherwise in good shape. None of the parts/components were missing. My spare tube and helmet were still in the side panniers. I brought the bike home, broke it down, oiled/greased everything, and put it back together.

Grease and oil everything
