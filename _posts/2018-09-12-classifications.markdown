When I grow up I want to be really cool.
That is why I will be spending an hour or two each day taking online courses for machine learning. 
Who knows, perhaps I will someday earn some rad bro points with my leet nerd skeelz :)

In my most recent tutorial, we are learning decision trees.
This is going to be comical because I am pretty sure I have forgotten all my math and will likely need to brush up on all the concepts.

#XOR 
is exponential
looks at every possible combination of a decision tree and then looks at whether the output has an even or odd true outputs.

#Linear
thought to be much easier than `XOR`. Basically, the decision tree makes for a straight line

#factorials
used to help describe an expressiveness of a decision trees. 4 factorial = `4!`. 

#nodes 
represents a test such as "is true?"

# truth table 
is a way of presenting binary function by populating a table with each boolean condition as a column. 
Each row represents a possible binary condition of either true or false
Each row is all the possible outcomes of those condition with an output of either true or false.

# Power of two
because the power of two is the base of the binary numeral system (0 and 1), it is commonly used in computer science.

# 2 to the 2n
is a way to describe the possible outputs from a `XOR` table 

if you have three rows then you have 64 possible outputs

2 to the n(2x3)
 
2 to the sixth power

2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 64
