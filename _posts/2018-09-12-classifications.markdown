Binary Classification is the process of arriving at a true or false target concept.
The process of arriving at a target concept involves classifying/generalizing the data to arrive at truthiness.
Once those inputs are classified, you can then use decision tree logic to help arrive at target concepts.
 

# Concepts for classification learning
instances (input)
concept function -> (True / False, (1,2,3,4), binary classification)
target concept -> answer
Hypothesis class -> selected functions
sample -> training set
candidate -> expected data to be 
testing set -> the data you use
