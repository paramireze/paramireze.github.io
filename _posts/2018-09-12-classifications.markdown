Machine learning is all about generalizing dats.
It is a data driven approach that teaches the machine learning algorithm to generalized using the data presented.
As a result, an algorithm can apply what it learned and look at new data with a chance of predicting correctly.
This is called inductive learning.

In the last tutorial, The instructions discussed some possible factors might go in to deciding if a person wants to go into a restaurant or not.
You use a series of questions that are either true or false and build a decision tree. 
For each question, you would need to create data sets that would help the algorithm determine if the answer is yes or no.

# Concepts for classification learning
instances (input)
concept function -> (True / False, (1,2,3,4), binary classification)
target concept -> answer/truthiness
Hypothesis class -> selected functions
sample -> training set
candidate -> expected data to be 
testing set -> the data you use
