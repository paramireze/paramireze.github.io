The app will allow users to rate their meals using a 5 star rating system. I will be creating a custom control within a `UI stackview` on the main storyboard. I will put the UI elements for the 5 star rating system in the custom control. 

# Archives and Serialization
Convert objects and values to and from property list, JSON, and other flat binary representations

# init(Frame:)
initializes and returns a newly allocated view object with the specified frame rectangle

# NSCoding
a protocol that enables an object to be encoded and decoded for archiving and distribution

{% highlight ruby %}
override init(frame: CGRect) {
    <#code#>
}
{% endhighlight %}
