I will be creating a 5 star rating system so app users are able to rate their meals. I will use a `Stack View` to hold the star system and then add logic to a custom control to update their feedback.

## Adding Initializer Placeholders
{% highlight ruby %}
override init(frame: CGRect) {
    <#code#>
}
{% endhighlight %}

`init(Frame:)` - initializes and returns a newly allocated view object with the specified frame rectangle

{% highlight ruby %}
required init(coder: NSCoder) {
	super.init(coder: coder)
}
{% endhighlight %}

# Archiving and Serialization 
Convert objects and values to and from property list, JSON, and other flat binary representations

`NSCoding` - a protocol that enables an object to be encoded and decoded for archiving and distribution
