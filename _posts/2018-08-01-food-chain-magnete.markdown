I spent the last weekend visiting door county. 
I grew up there and find that visiting as an adult is much more awesome :)

Over the weekend, I got to cook some good foods and hang out with family.

## Saturday

# Penninsula State Park

Hey that's where I am at now!

I am in middle of my morning bike ride through the area and stopped to write. 
There are deer all over the place. 
It is nice being away from the noise.

Thanks to the recommendations of the peoples of Door County's sub-reddit, I found a restaurant that opened extra early called `Julie's Cafe`.
 
## Sunday
# Morning Run and Coffee

I woke up early and ran to `Julie's Cafe`. They open the earliest and was the first customer there.
After toast, eggs, coffee and a bit of reading, I took off again back towards the condo. 
I hit up some trails in `Gilbralter Woods` before calling it a day.

## My Morning Strength & Conditioning Workouts 

Once again, no gym access requires a lot of body weight exercises.
I like to bring my resistance band to work rotator cuffs and do side straddles to strengthen glutes.


# Burpees

Burpees is a great way to do full body cardio without swimming :P
I will sometime do these with dumbbells.

# Scissor Lunges

I have a love hate relationship with scissor lunges. They produce a type of soreness that can make the next morning difficult.

# Rotator

Resistance bands are perfect for working the rotator cuffs.

# Side Steps

These make sure my `Medial Glutes` are nice and strong.
They help with stability and preventive injury.

## After Workout Meal

# Fried Veggies
I fried brocoli, sweet potato, and mushrooms in butter until brown and crisp.

# Pancake
Used two eggs, banana, blue berry, and a little bit of wheat pancake mix.

# Toast w/ turkey and strawberry
title says it :)
