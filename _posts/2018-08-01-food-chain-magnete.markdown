Experiencing Door County as a visitor is a strange feeling.
It feels liberating that it has always been here and I am free to come and go as I please.
I am lucky I had Door County as a home since it is thriving and always great to visit.

## Friday

# Fish Fry
I went to a Fish Fry in Sister Bay just next to Al Johnson's.
There was a keyboardist that was playing billy joel, steely dan and other hits.
I ordered two `Fanny Pack` IPAs.



## Food Chain Magnete

The day ended with me hanging out with my brother and playing `Food Chain Magnete`

It is a game where you try to earn more money than others. 
How you earn that money is up to you and what makes the game great. 




## Saturday

# Penninsula State Park

Hey that's where I am at now!

I am in middle of my morning bike ride through the area and stopped to write. 
It is kinda early and not a lot of people out yet. 
I am on my way to explore the area and find a coffee shop to do some reading.

## Julie's Cafe

I posted on the door county sub reddit asking for an early morning breakfast place.
I was told `Julie's Cafe` opened the earliest.


## Sister  Bay

Got a chance to do some swimming in `Sister Bay`. 
It was fun watching my nieces pieces play with the other kids and have fun.
I took a well needed nap on the beach.

We then went to wilsons for a scoop of ice cream.
