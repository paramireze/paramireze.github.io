Experiencing Door County as a visitor is a strange feeling.
It feels liberating that it has always been here and I am free to come and go as I please.
I am lucky I had Door County as a home since it is thriving and always great to visit.

## Friday

Friday was time spent with the family. 
I enjoyed a fish fry and drank lots of booze while learning `Food Chain Magnate`.

## Saturday

# Penninsula State Park

Hey that's where I am at now!

I am in middle of my morning bike ride through the area and stopped to write. 
It is kinda early and not a lot of people out yet. 
Thanks to the recommendations of the people of Door County, I found a restaurant that opened before 7am called `Julie's Cafe`.

## Sunday

# Morning Run and Coffee

I woke up early and ran to `Julie's Cafe`. They open the earliest and was the first customer there.
After toast, eggs, coffee and a bit of reading, I took off again back towards the condo. 
I hit up some trails in `Gilbralter Woods` before calling it a day.

## My Morning Strength & Conditioning Workouts 

Once again, no gym access requires a lot of body weight exercises.
I like to bring my resistance band to work rotator cuffs and do side straddles to strengthen glutes.


# Burpees

Big fan of burpees and do them often.
I feel it really engages all the muscles into working together.

# Scissor Lunges

Scissor lunges always smoke me and great to get some intensity into a body weight workout.

# Rotator

Resistance bands are perfect for wrapping around a tree and work the shoulders.
I like to keep up these exercises to make sure I am hitting up the smaller muscle groups.

# Side Steps

I am a runner and need to make sure that my `Medial Glutes` are nice a strong.
They help with stability and preventing injury.

## After Workout Meal

# Fried Veggies
I fried brocoli, sweet potato, and mushrooms in butter until brown and crisp.

# Pancake
Used two eggs, banana, blue berry, and a little bit of wheat pancake mix.

# Toast w/ turkey and strawberry
title says it :)
