# Existentialism - [allaboutphilosophy.org]({{ "https://www.allaboutphilosophy.org/existentialism.htm"}}) 

This source material on the subject is so well written. Reading it made me feel giddy inside because I can see how appealing, and how empowering existentialism can be. Basically, existentialism is the idea of free will, choice and personal responisibility.

Existentialism – What It Is and Isn’t
Existentialism takes into consideration the underlying concepts:
- Human free will
- Human nature is chosen through life choices
- A person is best when struggling against their individual nature, fighting for life
- Decisions are not without stress and consequences
- There are things that are not rational
- Personal responsibility and discipline is crucial
- Society is unnatural and its traditional religious and secular rules are arbitrary
- Worldly desire is futile

For me, I find it inspiring reading about how a generation of people coped with war, famine, depression and other misfortunes of the early 1900's and other time periods as well. One of those ways was through the idea of Existentialism

Existentialism is capabable with other structures of thought. The example given states that 

> An existentialist could either be a religious moralist, agnostic relativist, or an amoral atheist. Kierkegaard, a religious philosopher, Nietzsche, an anti-Christian, Sartre, an atheist, and Camus an atheist, are credited for their works and writings about existentialism
