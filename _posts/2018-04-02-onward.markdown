I reached a point in my career where I realized how uncertain things are. I always thought that there would be some guiding force pointing me on to the next thing. That there would be someone there who could help me navigate onward. 

It is easy to dwell on the negative. It is difficult to see opportunity. When I look closely enough, I see opportunity. I see a road to success. It means ignoring the negative all together. It means failing many times until success. I see it and I am going to go for it. Every part of my being. Every ounce of my soul. I owe it to those co-workers who fought to get what we have. i owe it to my family to make this a character defining experience. I owe it to myself to show that I can persevere.
