This blog uses the Jekyll Framework. It uses Markdown language so bloggers are able to create rich content. For example, I can `highlight` stuff just like that :) 

Jekyll also allows for users to modify the layouts of their posts. This is done by overriding the default layout in the theme by creating a copy. 

The concept of overriding the defaults is a powerful tool when it comes to creating a website that requires little maintenance. You keep an original copy of the original theme files and make modification to them in a separate location. That way theme developers are able to make updates without directly interfering with your custom styling and logic. 

Jekyll has great documentation and makes the process easy. I highly recommend anyone with any html experience to try it for themselves.
