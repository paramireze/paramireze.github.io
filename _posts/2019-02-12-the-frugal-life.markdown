Starting with this post, I plan on making a monthly post discussing my expenses.
My goal is to gather as much discipline as possible and see how much I can reduce my spending.

## January

January was particularly expensive because I traveled to Florida and paid for hotels and restaurants.

## strategies

I have a few ideas on how to reduce my spending quite a bit. 
I believe the categories listed below should get me 80% of the way to where I want to be.

# learning

I find learning new things is the best way to find purpose and stay focused.
There are some free online courses that I am participating in to stay on top of new software technologies.

# food

For the last few weeks, I have been getting most my calories from rice, beans, potatoes, eggs, greens, and nuts.

# weekends

Weekends can be tough staying in and not hitting up the bars with friends.
I have been successful lately finding healthy activities to pre-occupy my time and will continue to explore alternative means of recreation. 

# entertainment

My roommate and I enjoy playing board games and classic nintendo. 
I also have a renewed love for reading.
Also, I find that running and biking to be a great source of pleasure for me.  

## conclusion

If I have planned well, then my next post should show some impressive results. 
The key to success is to have activities that are engaging to occupy my time. 
Otherwise, I can easily imagine myself hanging out at the bars as I would routinely do in the past.
