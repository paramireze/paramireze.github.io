Starting this month, I am going to find ways to reduce spending.
The reason being is to see if I can.


## January

January was particularly expensive month since I went on  vacation in Florida.

## strategies

To start with, my plan is to figure out `activities`, `food`, and `weekends` since those are all area's that impact my spending decisions.  

# activities

Much of my time is taking up by coursera online classes, reading books, and cardio exercises.

# food

Lots and lots of inexpensive plant based foods, except cashews and avocado's.

# weekends

If I have done my job well, my activities should keep me from getting too bored and spending money out at movies or restaurants. 
Not that i have a problem with those things, I rather not do them out of boredom, rather as an event. 

## conclusion

My next post should show some impressive results, assuming I stick to the plan.
