Starting with this post, I plan on making a monthly post discussing my expenses.
My goal is to gather as much discipline as possible and see how much I can reduce my spending.

## January

January was particularly expensive because I traveled to Florida and paid for hotels and restaurants.

## strategies

I have a few ideas on how to reduce my spending quite a bit. 
I believe the categories listed below should get me 80% of the way to where I want to be.

# learning

I find learning new things is the best way to find purpose and stay focused.
There are some free online courses that I am participating in to stay on top of new software technologies.

# food

Something I sometimes tell my friends is I believe there is a war on cheap food. 
What better way to get Americans to pay lots of money for food?
Now that I got that out of the way, most my calories will come from rice, beans, potatoes, eggs, and nuts.
I do like to buy fresh salad fixings and sometimes popcorn.

# weekends

I am pretty good about avoiding bars and restaurants. 
I will be extra vigilent to keep up that habit.

# entertainment

My roommate and I enjoy playing board games and classic nintendo. 
I also read quite a bit as well as write letters and blog.
All of these items combined is my strategy 

## conclusion

If I have planned well, then my next post should show some impressive results. 
The key to success is to have activities that are engaging to occupy my time. 
Otherwise, I can easily imagine myself hanging out at the bars as I would routinely do in the past.
