Starting this month, I am going to find ways to reduce spending.
The reason being is to see if I can.


## January

January was particularly expensive month since I went on  vacation in Florida.

## strategies

I have a few ideas on how to reduce my spending.

# activities

Much of my time is taking up by coursera courses, reading books, and doing workouts at the gym

# food

Beans, Rice, Potatoes, and eggs are going to be my staples.

# weekends

If I have done my job well, my activities should carry me through the weekends and away from excessive boozing.
Don't get me wrong, boozing will happen, just in a moderate amount.

# additional entertainment

My roommate and I enjoy playing board games and classic nintendo. 
I also have a renewed love for reading.
Also, I find that running and biking to be a great source of pleasure for me.  

## conclusion

My next post should show some impressive results, assuming I stick to the plan.
