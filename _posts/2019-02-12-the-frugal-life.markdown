Starting with this post, I plan on making a monthly post discussing my expenses.
My goal is to gather as much discipline as possible and see how much I can reduce my expenses.

## January

This is what my expenses looked like for Jan.
January was particularly expensive because I traveled to Florida and paid for hotels and restaurants.

## strategies

I have a few ideas on how to reduce my spending quite a bit. 

# hobbies

For starters, I will be dedicating much of my time to online courses for machine learning.
Considering how much energy is required, I will typically take more naps and find excuses to hit the bed early.
Also, I made it through 1/10 novels by Steven Erikson's Malazan Series.
Finally, I am hitting the gym 2 - 3 times a day.

# food

For the last few days, I have been eating lots of rice, bean, eggs, potatoes, nuts, and popcorn for snack.
It is my intention to get most my calories from these sources, making it a very inexpensive, but highly dense source of nutrition

# weekends

I plan on occasionally buying a six pack when hanging out with friends 

## final thoughts

I believe if I follow through on this strategy and avoid unexpected expenses (fingers crossed), I can get my expenses down to $1800 this month.
I spent about $200 on a Party I threw for Febuary, however, I hope to minimize all other expenses.
