The first thing I am noticing when learning Java is all the various declaration types when it comes to variables, constants, methods and functions. I am use to weakly typed languages like PHP and javascript where programmers can easily code in jibberish.

I see `public`, `private`, `protected` being used and remember well from my education how they are used. However, I do not understand `final`, `void`, `static`. 

- `static`: only one variable instance exists for all objects. They share the variable
 
- `final`: the value cannot be changed after it is intialized. Also known as a constant

- `static final`: means only one instance of the variable no matter how many classes are built.  

- `void`: no return value! so simple and yet so foreign
