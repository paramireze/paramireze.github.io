In one of the tutorials, I noticed I was having a difficult time understanding how to get the UI elements to line up right. So I do what I normally do when I get stuck and frustrated, I read. In an article by `Medium`, they had a small tutorial working with `stackviews`. Basically, the goal was to line up your column and rows of elements inside stackviews. Once the elements and stackviews were created, we then created constraints for the stackviews fr the `alignment`, `spacing`, and `distribution` properties. Once those were set, then the spacing of the form elements were distributed equally within their stackviews and displayed nicely among the various screen sizes and portrait/landscape mode.
