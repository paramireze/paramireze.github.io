[sunshine exercise 6.02]({{ "https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud851/lessons/1392b674-18b6-4636-b36b-da7d37a319e3/concepts/2b863b87-8bef-4cb1-b5e0-17c12b73a2a8" }})

In this exercise, we added a checkbox that allows users to turn the bass visualizer off as a preference setting. As you can see from the diagram, there is a lot going on when navigating through the applications. we added the `SettingsActivity` and the `SettingsFragment` to handle the logic for preference settings.
