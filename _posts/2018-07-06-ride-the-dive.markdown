Ride the dive is a poker ride, meaning there will be 5 stops and you draw a card at each stop. Person with the best hand at the end of the night wins the poker ride. There is a $10 buy in and winner takes all. Each bar is typically considered a dive bar to varying degrees. Last years ride ended at the `Up North` bar at 2:00am.

Last years ride was the first time the event took place. It was hosted by both Stiffy and his brother Jon. The start was on cottage groove road and went clockwise along the lake. We stopped at Nutfarmers, Antlers, Hookah Lounge and Up North. I had a lot of fun last year and thought I paced myself well. 

This years start took place at working draft brewery. There was a walking pub crawl

My friend `Mr. OTC` recently won a home brewing contest and had his beer on tap at `Working Draft` called `Basement Warfare`. It is a chocolate stout.
