For the second year in a row, the hash house harriers put on the `Ride the Dive` pub crawl event. 
 It is a `Poker ride` meaning you get a playing card at each bar and who ever has the best poker hand at the 5th bar wins! 
 10$ buy in and winner take all.

For our poker ride, we hit up  
- working draft brewery
- busse's
- sundown
- snicks
- baldwin

The riding between bars was the most fun for me. 
Riding with a group of people you've known for years while enjoying a night out is something special.
It was especially made enjoyable that the weather was nice and it was a weekend.

## working draft

The start took place at the home of the newest Madison brewery `Working Draft`. They specialize in IPA's and located at the heart of the east side of Madison, near `Central Park`. My good friend `OTC` had his beer on tap called `Basement Warfare`.

## busse's

We rode north east to `Busse's bar`. The bar looks as if it was built in someone's house and turned into a bar. We hung out in the backroom and played pool and darts. `Jeff Daniel` had a game winning dart throw by landing an 8, which was quite impressive given the skill level among our group. 

## sundown

Next stop was `Sundown Saloon`. This is a bar I had not been to before. The place was much bigger than `Busses` and I enjoyed having room to sit and talk comfortably. More darts were played and beer was drank. I think My poker cards were crap and didn't much pay attention to what was going on far as the poker aspect. 

## snicks

Is another bar I had not been to before and had the most fun here playing ping pong. The alcohol was noticeably kicking in at this point as our energy levels were going strong. 
 
## baldwin

Final stop was at baldwin. We met up with another group of pub crawlers. I got to meet the newly married Trapper and his wife Rachael. Twas a good night
