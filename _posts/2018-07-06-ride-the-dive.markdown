Ride the dive is a poker ride, meaning there will be 5 stops and you draw a card at each stop. Person with the best hand at the end of the night wins the poker ride. There is a $10 buy in and winner takes all. Each bar is typically considered a dive bar to varying degrees. Last years ride ended at the `Up North` bar at 2:00am.

Last years ride was the first time the event took place. It was hosted by both Stiffy and his brother Jon. The start was on cottage groove road and went clockwise along the lake. We stopped at Nutfarmers, Antlers, Hookah Lounge and Up North. I had a lot of fun last year and thought I paced myself well. 

This years start took place at working draft brewery. There was a walking pub crawl

My friend `Mr. OTC` recently won a home brewing contest and had his beer on tap at `Working Draft` called `Basement Warfare`. It is a chocolate stout.

I drew a 6 of clubs and headed out on our bike poker ride shortly there after. we rode north east through the shorewood hills neighborhood and ended up at `Busses Bar`. The locals were surprised to see 15 cyclist come in and managed to handle it well. A guy named brian gave us pizza as well.

I then drew a jack and we were off again. We rode east to `Sundown Saloon`. The place was spacious and I particularly liked the bar area itself with the mirror that gave the illusion of being half the size.

I drew an Ace and we were off again, headed south this time. We went across cottage groove and buckeye rd, and stopped at 

We stopped by `Nutfarmers` household to do an imprumptu beer check, however, he was closing shop for the night so we continued on our merry. At this time, there were about 7 cyclist left. 

Our ride leader coordinated with the pub crawl coordinater and both groups met at baldwin street and grille for the final stop. I then lost miserably in the poker game and concluded the night there
