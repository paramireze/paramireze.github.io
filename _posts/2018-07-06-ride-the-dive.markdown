This was the second year of `Ride the Dive` poker bike ride event. The format for this event is simple. You stop at 5 bars and get a playing card at each stop. Who ever has the best hand by the end of the night wins the monies. 


## working draft

This years start took place at working draft brewery. The place just opened and has a great interior. The brewery is conveniently located right near `Central Park`.  

My friend `Mr. OTC` recently won a home brewing contest and had his beer on tap at `Working Draft` called `Basement Warfare`. It is a chocolate stout.

`Busses` is a small bar located off of Sherman ave. It is a bit cramped in the front of the bar, however, we went to the back room where they had a pool table and dart board. The locals were complaining that the pool table was tilted to one corner and did not advise playing. It was fun watching `WC`, `MLA`, and `Jeff Daniels`play darts. They needed to get the exact score to win and `Jeff Daniels`  managed to hit a 8 to win the game. It was a crazy good throw.

## sundown
I then drew a jack and we were off again. We rode east to `Sundown Saloon`. The place was spacious and I particularly liked the bar area itself with the mirror that gave the illusion of being half the size.

I drew an Ace and we were off again, headed south this time. We went across cottage groove and buckeye rd, and stopped at 

We stopped by `Nutfarmers` household to do an imprumptu beer check, however, he was closing shop for the night so we continued on our merry. At this time, there were about 7 cyclist left. 

## snicks
our forth stop took place at `Snicks sports pub`. I ordered some hopolicious and played ping pong with `MLA`, `WC`, and `Porkins`. We were pretty good and fun had

## baldwin
Our ride leader coordinated with the pub crawl coordinater and both groups met at baldwin street and grille for the final stop. I then lost miserably in the poker game and concluded the night there
