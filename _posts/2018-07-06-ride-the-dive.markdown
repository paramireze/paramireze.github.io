For the second year in a row, the hash house harriers put on the `Ride the Dive` pub crawl event. 
 It is a `Poker ride` meaning you get a playing card at each bar and who ever has the best poker hand at the 5th bar wins! 
 10$ buy in and winner take all.

For our poker ride, we hit up  
- working draft brewery
- busse's
- sundown
- snicks
- baldwin

The riding between bars was the most fun for me. 
Riding with a group of people you've known for years while enjoying a night out is something special.
It was especially made enjoyable that the weather was nice and it was a weekend. Also ping pong was lots of fun at `snicks`
