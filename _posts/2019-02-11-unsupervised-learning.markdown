Unsupervised Learning is a way of gaining insight from data when we normally wouldn't be able to. 

This is typically done by algorithms looking at relationships among various datasets.

In this last session, `clustering` and `non-clustering` were explained to be two ways that an algorithm can derive information from unsupervised learning.

clustering is the process of grouping data

non-clustering is a bit trickier for me to explain. The video gave the example of filtering out sounds from a loud room.
