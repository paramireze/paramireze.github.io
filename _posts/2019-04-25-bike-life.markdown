A typical hash run consist of three parts. The Run, Beer Checks, the On-In (after party) 


## the run 

I set a 5 mile route starting from main street depot. 
I set the trail so the first beer check took place on top of a large hill, overlooking Villas Zoo and the surrounding area.
The group was able to enjoy a panoromic view of the area.

### The transporting beer

What better to have fun with the running event than transporting all parties supply via cargo bike.
Some of the riders would jump on back as I was moving
