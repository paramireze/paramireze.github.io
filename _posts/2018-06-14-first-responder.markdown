An application is able to create an interface through the use of view objects. Everytime a new element is added to the GUI, a view object is created and all mapped together using view hierarchies. For example, when a developer adds a text field to the view controller, a UITextField object is created which is a subclass of 

![UI Kit Framework]({{ '/assets/ios/june/ui_kit.png' }})
![View Hierarchy]({{ '/assets/ios/june/view_hierarchy.png' }})
