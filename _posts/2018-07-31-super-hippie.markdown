7 steps to be an O.G like me :) 


- sell your car and get a bike
- skip your smart phone in a nearby lake and buy a flip. An iPhone skips about 8 times last time i checked ;)
- delete your facebook, twitter, and instagram accounts
- stop paying charter for internet and buy books instead
- give your mom lots of hugs and make her great food
- be silly and hang out with friends, preferably with beer
