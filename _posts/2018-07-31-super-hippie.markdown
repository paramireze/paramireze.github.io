7 steps to be an O.G like me :) 


- step 1: sell your car
- step 2: skip your smart phone in a nearby lake and buy a flip. An iPhone skips about 8 times last time i checked ;)
- step 3: quit social media
- sept 4: get rid of internet at home
- step 6: cook good foods and read great literature
- step 7: be silly and hang out with friends, preferably with beer
