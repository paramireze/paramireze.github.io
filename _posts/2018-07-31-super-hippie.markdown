7 steps to be an O.G like me :) 


- step 1: sell your car and get a bike
- step 2: skip your smart phone in a nearby lake and buy a flip. An iPhone skips about 8 times last time i checked ;)
- step 3: delete your facebook, twitter, and instagram accounts
- sept 4: stop paying charter for internet and buy books instead
- step 6: give your mom lots of hugs and make her great food
- step 7: be silly and hang out with friends, preferably with beer
