e-Patient Dave is a cancer survivor from 2006. Hey had stage 4 Kidney cancer and was able to beat it using a dangerous drug that could have killed him. e-Patient Dave was also able to beat his cancer by relying on a network patient community that would communicate their experiences and treatments with one another. 

e-Patient Dave's spoke today as our keynote speaker. His message to the medical community is that the future heathcare is empowerment. He claims that healthcare is better off having multidirectional communications among healthcare professionals, patients and their friends/families. He demonstrates past cases where patients took their healthcare into their own hands and were able to research and come up with custom treatment plans. They were to do this by going behind the backs of their care providers in some cases. In other cases, the more progressive physicians were able to assist in their personal journy to discover treatment. 

e-Patient daves message to everyone at the conference today is that the future in healthcare is the patient. Patients is a valuable resource for researching and providing data. Our current model does not treat the patient as a partner and over-burdens  health professionals with doing all the work themselves.
