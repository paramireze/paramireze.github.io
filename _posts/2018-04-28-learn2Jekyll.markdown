This is the first time I used a framework like Jekyll. I will be going over the technologies the framework uses. 

# Markdown
Markdown answers the question, how do I display html without writing it? Markdown allows a website to render Rich text using plain text. 

# Markdown Extra
here is a copy pasta from `[wikipedia]({{ "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" }})`

It adds the following features to Markdown:

* Markdown inside HTML blocks
* Elements with id/class attributes
* Fenced code blocks
* Tables[34]
* Definition lists
* Footnotes
* Abbreviations

`code(show me what your code looks like)`
