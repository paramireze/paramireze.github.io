Overall, this was an expensive month for me. I am more social lately and spending more time going out hence the ATM usage. 
I am partially wondering if it is because my job requires me to be more communicative for a project I am now working on.

## Top 5 spendings

# turning 38
For my birthday, I hosted a hash run for the Hash House Harriers.
I set a 6 mile running trail, with two beer stops, and an after party at my place.
There was plenty of food and drink for over 40 people.

# modernizing house of mom
Decided to hook my mom up with some decent kitchen gear and a shoe rack.


# Fooding
nothing out of the ordinary


# cash atm
