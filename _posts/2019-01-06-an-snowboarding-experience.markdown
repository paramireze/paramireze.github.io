for the weekend after new years, I will spend a 4 day weekend running, snowboarding, drinking beer and video games in Hurley Wisconsin.

## The Destination

For the weekend, I will be hanging out in a rented home in Hurley Wisconsin with a dozen others.

## Running

Each morning I would wake up and go for a run on snow covered side-walks and trails

### Tactical Gear

I particularly enjoy using the Salomon Speedcross 3 shoes for anything with snow

### Day 2
With most everyone hungover, including myself, I decided to run some cross country ski and snowshoeing trails that were nearby

### Day 3
I stopped in a cafe in town to work on an iphone app

## Concussion ;)

During each run, I would find playground equipment to do pullups and dips. I tried to eat salads at restaurants while with friends and limit my calorie intake.
