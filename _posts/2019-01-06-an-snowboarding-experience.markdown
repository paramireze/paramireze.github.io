To kick off 2019, I descended upon Hurley Wisconsin with a dozen other hashers.

## The Goal

Snowboard, drink beer, be active, and drink more beer

## The Destination

For the weekend, I hung out in Hurley Wisconsin with a dozen others from my drinking club.

## Summarizing the weekend

I hurt myself pretty bad learning how to snowboard and spent a lot of time doing my own thing. 
I spent a lot of time on my own venturing about while others were bombing down the hills. 
The nights typically involved hitting up the infamous silver st.

## Killing time

There was a lot of downtime with plenty of activities, including a sauna which we discovered can fit 9 hashers at once.

## Running

I would run a couple times a day. Here are some routes. I found some snowcovered snowshoeing/ski trails that was especially pleasant.
I used playground equipment at various parks for upper body workouts.

### Tactical Gear

I particularly enjoy using my Salomon Speedcross 3 shoes for anything snow related.

For commuting in the snowy/icy conditions, I used my `Stache` Mtn Bike.
