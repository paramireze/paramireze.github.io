Reference counting describe how an application tracks references and pointers for objects and whatnot. Most typical use case for reference counting is for garbage collection.  

Swift uses `Automatic Reference Counting` behind the scenes to manage a devices resources optimally. However, there are a few cases which a person needs to define weak references such is `IBInput` and `IBOutput`. 

{% highlight ruby %}
var john: Person?
var unit4A: Apartment?

john = Person(name: "John Appleseed")
unit4A = Apartment(unit: "4A")

john!.apartment = unit4A
unit4A!.tenant = john
{% endhighlight %}
