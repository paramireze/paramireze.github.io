Last January, I decided to learn mobile development. At first with android and then iOS. My life has taken on radical changes since then. For one, I drink a lot less alcohol. I no longer felt capable of depriving myself of sleep, money, and body hydration when I could be working on tutorials. It was extremely tough for me to say "No" to my friends. I imagined they would be upset if I did which is a weird thing to think in retrospect. All of my friends have been supportive and have shown excitment to see me when I do feel motivated to go out for a drink.  

I sleep less. My alarm is set for 5:00 am, however, I wake up around 4:45am. I usually can't wait to get my day started. My morning routine is to hit the gym at 5am when they open and then run to the coffee shop to work on tutorials. I also like to be in bed sometimes around 10pm

I no longer have the patience to do long workout sessions. Instead I will do short 20-30 minute workout sessions. I will usually hit up two or three HIIT classes at my gym in a week. Overall, I think I am doing well far as maintaining the gainz ;)
