I usually dedicate 2 - 4 hours a day to mobile development. 1-2 hours before and after work and usually much more on the weekends if I am not at work. This may sound like bragging or maybe it sounds sad to you. To me, that is just reality. I think that way. I dream that way. I am not sure why I am that way. My best guess is that it is the only thing that makes sense to me.  

I hadn't always been that way. I use to only develop things as a means for a paycheck. I would work hard when I was on the clock and then put all that away when the day was over. I use to go out with friends frequently and do things that I would use to consider fun. 

If I had to say the thing that I have noticed the most since taking up software development obsessively, is I am less lonely. I know it sounds counter intuitive, however, for the first time I feel like i have something to communicate. Spending long periods of time building something, being creative, allows me to feel connected to others.
