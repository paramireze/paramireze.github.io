Last January, I decided to learn mobile development. At first with android and then iOS. My life has taken on radical changes since then. For one, I drink a lot less alcohol. At first, it was extremely tough for me to say "No" to fun having at the bars. I find that I now feel the opposite. 

I have also have noticed that my sleep schedule is a lot different. I am now a fithy morning person. I can't explain how energizing it is for me to spend a solid 1-2 hours learning at my own pace. No pressure from work or anyone else to get something done. Just me exploring my way through tutorials learning something new. I usually wake up before my alarm goes off and on the go. 

I am not in the gym nearly as much. I eat right and do strength training, however, I am not putting in the long hours I once did working on buiding strength and endurance.
