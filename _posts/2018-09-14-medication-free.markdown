A few months back, I went on a week long camping trip and forgot my Asthma and allergy medications.
It was a bit terrifying but I figured I should be okay until I got back.
WHen I did eventually get back home and was ready to start up on my medications, I realized I felt fine. 
So I decided that I would carry my medications with me but not take any unless my symptoms came back.

I do have trouble with my allergies if I am swimming. I will sneeze and get watery eyes.
Otherwise, to the best of my knowledge I am mostly cured of both Asthma and Dust-mite allergies.
My activity level is higher than it has ever been and my lungs feel great.

It is unknown to me why I needed those medications.
The doctors never tested or bothered to check.
