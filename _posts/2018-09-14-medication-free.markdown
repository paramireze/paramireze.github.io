A few months back, I went on a week long camping trip and forgot my asthma and allergy medications.
It was a bit terrifying but I figured I should be okay until I got back.
I eventually got back to civilization and had medication in hand. 
It occured to me that I felt fine and was curious what would happened if I stop taking medications all together.

This was also scary to me.
I have been taking medications almost daily for 10 years.
At first, my asthma was giving me trouble.
My breathing felt a bit constricted at times so I would do breathing exercises to help relax and loosen up my lungs.
It worked, after two weeks, for the last time, I never felt the symptoms of asthma. 

My allergies have since gone away too except when I am swimming.
It use to be that I would puff up from dust mites, however, that has not been the case.

It is a strange thing being cured of what were supposed to be irreversible conditions.
My goal moving forward is to explore idea's and concepts that I hold to be true and challenge them.
