A few months back, I went on a week long camping trip and forgot my Asthma and allergy medications.
It was a bit terrifying but I figured I should be okay until I got back.
WHen I did eventually get back home and was ready to start up on my medications, I realized I felt fine. 
So I decided that I would carry my medications with me but not take any unless my symptoms came back.

I do have trouble with my allergies if I am swimming. I will sneeze and get watery eyes.
My asthma was giving me a bit of trouble.
Whenever I felt the symptoms, I would breathed slowly and steady.
It wasn't long until my asthma symptoms was completely gone. 
Maybe after a couple of weeks off the meds.

It is a strange thing being cured of what were supposed to be irreversible conditions.
You wonder how and why this happened. 
Years of taking medication every day and they may not had been necessary?
Like i said, it is a strange thing.

It is also a strange thing to be free medication.
I thought I wouldn't be able to run or bike without it.
Now I can live comfortably within my own body without any help.
