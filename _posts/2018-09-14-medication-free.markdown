A few months back, I went on a week long camping trip and forgot my Asthma and allergy medications.
It was a bit terrifying but I figured I should be okay until I got back.
WHen I did eventually get back home and was ready to start up on my medications, I realized I felt fine. 
So I decided that I would carry my medications with me but not take any unless my symptoms came back.

I do have trouble with my allergies if I am swimming. I will sneeze and get watery eyes.
My asthma was giving me a bit of trouble.
Whenever I felt the symptoms, I would breathed slowly and steady.
It wasn't long until my asthma symptoms was completely gone. 
Maybe after a couple of weeks off the meds.

To the best of my knowledge I am mostly cured of both Asthma and allergies.
It is unknown to me why I needed those medications.
I was told that I did and I never questioned it.
I am now able to live comfortable within my own body without medication.
Damn it feels good to be a gangster :)
