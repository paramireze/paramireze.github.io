To learn the testing suites in Ruby Rails, I will be building a CRUD application using test driven design approach. 
I set up the new project in docker and host the application on heroku.

Docker makes certain that the behaviors and appearance of your application that is running on your computer is identical to how it looks and behaves on any other server.
If you ever build software, you know this is a huge help.
Before I used docker, it was not uncommon to see bugs and styling differences while demo'ing an application to clients.

```
# heroku

Heroku provides an slick command line tool that allows me to deploy the application to a live production server.
This has the advantage of allowing me to focus on coding and being able to quickly show my changes to anyone around the world.
That can be useful when working with clients, buddies, or applying for a job and you want to show off your skills.
