Well, I've done it. I killed Pitch Perfect app. Time of death? 6:29. Family has stated that the app is DNR. May you go in peace my friend.

I made one major rookie mistake. No version control. I figured, these were tutorials and I didn't need it... we are hiring a developer at work and I got done lecturing an appilicant about always using version control. Poor kid, he didn't know better. I did though and I still failed. 

I went through all the motions. Step through code, check stackoverflow. There are no error messages. I could persue this further, however, I find that this is a good opportunity to see how much of the project I can recreate from memory. That means I will need to set up two view controllers, Navigation controller, a segue communicating between the controllers, constraints, labels, buttons, IBoutput/IBinput. I got this!
