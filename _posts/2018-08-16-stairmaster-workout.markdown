I value my time and try to find ways to get the most out of my morning workouts. 
I came up with a exercise that I feel will get me strong fast and home in time for breakfast. 

## Weighted Stair Master using Dumbbells

# equipment 
- stairmaster
- two dumbbells
- a willingness to suffer :)  

# workout
While on the stairmaster, I will rotate through a few dumbbell exercises, usually 1 minute per set.

- hold dumbbells at side like a wheelbarrel
- hold dumbbells center on your chest similar to carrying a kayak or canoe shoulder height
- do a double handed over head press as if you are lifting the kayak up high. 

I happen to really like kayaks ;).

Once I am done with all three sets, I will rest my upper body for one minute by placing a dumbbell on each leg and do leg lifts for one minute.

# Sweet Potato Pancake

Gotta treat yourself after working hard.
Here's one of my favorites.

- 1 microwaved sweet potato
- bit of butter
- two eggs
- strawberries
- avocado
- salt & pepper

BOOM! that is how you start your day.
