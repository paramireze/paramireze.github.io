I value my time and try to find ways to get the most out of my morning workouts. 
I came up with a exercise that I feel will get my strong fast. 

## Weighted Stair Master using Dumbbells
![Stairmaster]({{ '/assets/images/2018/aug/stairmaster.png' }})

# equipment 
- stairmaster
- two dumbbells (I use 22.5lb)  

# workout
While on the stairmaster, I will rotate through a few dumbbell exercises, usually 1 minute per set.

- hold dumbbells at side like you are holding a wheelbarrel
- hold dumbbells center on your chest like you are lifting the end of a kayak or canoe
- do a double handed over head press

Once I rotate through those three lifts/holds, I will rest my upper body for one minute by placing a dumbbell on each leg and do leg lifts.
I have been doing this workout for quite a while and worked up to 20 minutes using 22.5lb dumbbells.

# Sweet Potato Pancake

Gotta treat yourself after working hard.
Here's one of my favorites.

- 1 microwaved sweet potato
- bit of butter
- two eggs
- strawberries
- avocado
- salt & pepper

I mix the softened sweet potato (microwave it) with the eggs and butter.
Fry on skillet like a pancake.
Cover with avocado and strawberry once done.
