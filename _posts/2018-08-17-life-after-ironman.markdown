I remember the very moment when I realized that I was done with Ironman.
I was in the car with my girlfriend at the time and reading short stories told by endurance athletes.
One athelete talked about his first Ironman sometime in the 80's.
He knew very little about the event and borrowed some crappy bike to race with.
The event was very unstructured and would sometimes take people days to finish.
He would stop at restaurants and sleep at a hotel.
He was congratulated by a cardboard sign at the finish line 24 hours later, after the start.
I thought to myself, I will never have that cool of a story to tell doing the same things each year.
That is when I announced that I was done with Ironman.


# Life After Ironman
Being an "Ironman" was my identity.
People would call me ironman, and still do.
For that reason, I think it is why it took me so long to move on onto the next stage of my life.
Once I removed the pressure of feeling like I had to train, I was able to start enjoying it again.
Thanks to the habits I learned from triathloning, and the renewed sense of enjoyment I gained, 
I am biking and running more than I ever have. 
I have been creative and incorporate running into my daily commutes.
Also, I try to ride out to sun prairie once a day to have dinner with mom.
