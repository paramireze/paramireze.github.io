For four years, I've trained 2 - 6 hours almost everyday to be a contender in the ironman competition.
I have finished in the top 1% for all of my races.
My strongest event is the bike.
My time on the bike is comparable to many pro athletes.
I believe my weakness is poor running technique and work today to improve it.

Quitting ironman was a difficult choice for me.
I was no longer getting enough return for my investment. 
It wasn't like I was going to stop being healthy once I quit.
So I quit, and that was that,
 
There was a time in my life that I spent the same amount of time playing world of warcraft.
It was not easy giving that up either.

I look at ironman training as scaffolding to my current life.
