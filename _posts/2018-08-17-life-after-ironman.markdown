For years, I've trained everyday for the Ironman competition here in Madison, WI.
I have finished in the top 1% for all of my races.
My strongest event is the bike.
My time on the bike is comparable to many pro athletes.

## what went wrong
I realized I wasn't having fun. When I first started, it was the audacity of the entire thing that appealed to me. 
Making the sport my lifestyle was not exactly what I had in mind, however, that is what happened.
I bought the expensive bike and gear. I swam every morning before work. I would do long grueling bike rides alone while my friends were hanging out.
Don't get me wrong, there are health benefits to this lifestyle, however, it came at a cost to my own well-being far as happiness.

## quitting
Being an Ironman, I thought, was who I was as a person.
When people looked at me, I believed that they saw the person who I was aspiring to become, a full-time triathlete.
That is what made quitting so difficult. 

## life after ironman

I restructured my workouts to be more well-rounded and more preventitive towards injuries.
Instead of competing in triathlons, I am doing races that my friends are doing. For example, I did a marathon in northern wisconsin with a group of friends. I also traveled to Idaho to do a gravel ride race up in the mountains.

## conclusion
Quitting ironman was just the start. I retained my habit for exercise and eating well. I learned to enjoy exercising again and look forward to it everyday.
