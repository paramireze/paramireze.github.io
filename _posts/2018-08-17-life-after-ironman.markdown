I remember well the moment when I was done with Ironman.
I was reading short stories by endurance athletes and one athlete wrote about his first Ironman.
He knew very little about the event and borrowed some crappy bike to race with.
The event was in the early days of ironman and was very unstructured. 
It would sometimes take days for people to finish.
He talked about stopping at restaurants and sleeping at a hotel.
He was congratulated by a cardboard sign at the finish line around 24 hours later after the start.
Upon reading that, I thought to myself, I am done with Ironman.
I announced it to those around me when I read that.


# Life After Ironman
Being an "Ironman" was my identity.
People would call me ironman, and still do.
For that reason, I think it is why it took me so long to move on.
Once I removed the pressure of feeling like I had to bike and run all day everyday, I was able to start enjoy running and biking again.
I am biking and running just as much, if not more.
Leaving ironman was not an end for me. 
It is just a beginning.
I leave wednesday for a 100 mile gravel ride with my friend Stephen Wasmund.
I am no longer confined to a specific activity.
