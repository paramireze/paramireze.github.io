For years, I've trained everyday for the Ironman competition here in Madison, WI.
I did well for all of my races, especially for the bike event.
I never took the event too seriously and tried to have as much fun as possible.
It was not uncommon to go through 2-3 beers during the run.

## what went wrong
I was burned out by the second year. 
I didn't realize it at the time. Looking back, it seemed like almost everyone else could see it clearly and would try to let me know. 
When I first started, it was the audacity of the entire thing that appealed to me.
I was already biking and running everyday for funsies and Ironman wasn't that much of a leap for me. 
Making the sport my lifestyle was not exactly what I had in mind although that is what happened for four years.
To this day I scratch my head quite vigorously trying to figure out how that happened.
 

## quitting
Quitting Ironman was tough for me.
I thought I was somehow letting people down, that I was an inspiration to my family and friends and they were depending on me.
I truly thought that I was somehow hurting other people if I chose to quit competing.
It never occured to me how insulting that is to others and myself.
That perception was self induced.
However, perhaps this is a valuable lesson for me. 
It explains how I sometimes end up taking on roles that I had not initially planned. 


## life after ironman
Once I decided that I was done with Ironman, I rediscovered my love for adventuring.
I now strap a backpack every morning with my gear and laptop and run wherever I am going.
I enjoy traveling and doing endurance events with friends.
My evening are usually spent pushing a cargo bike, running with friends, or hanging out at the gym.  

## conclusion
The ultimate lesson I learned is people are not stupid. 
I was not fooling anyone by thinking I was doing others favors by doing something I was not absolutely certain about.
Furthermore, I learned that I need to listen to the feedback people are giving me.
There were many warning signs before I reached full burnout.
