For years, I've trained everyday for the Ironman competition here in Madison, WI.
I did well for all of my races, especially for the bike event.
I never took the event too seriously and tried to have as much fun as possible.
It was not uncommon to go through 2-3 beers during the run.

## what went wrong
I was burned out by the second year. 
I didn't realize it at the time. Looking back, it seemed like almost everyone else could see it clearly and would try to let me know. 
When I first started, it was the audacity of the entire thing that appealed to me.
I was already biking and running everyday for funsies and Ironman wasn't that much of a leap for me. 
Making the sport my lifestyle was not exactly what I had in mind although that is what happened for four years.
To this day I scratch my head quite vigorously trying to figure out how that happened.
 

## quitting
Quitting Ironman was tough for me.
I thought I was somehow letting people down, that I was an inspiration to my family and friends and they were depending on me.
That perception was self induced and not sure how I arrived at those conclusions.
It is interesting to think about since it could explain other behaviors that aren't necessarily in my own self-interest.

## life after ironman
After throwing in the towel, I rediscovered my love for adventuring.
Every morning, I strap on a backpack and run commute to work or wherever I happen to be going.
I enjoy traveling and doing endurance events with friends and couldn't care less about time/speed.  

## conclusion
I have realized that people are able to see what I am completely blind to. If open-minded, I can avoid a lot of pain and hardship by listen to the feedback people are giving me.
