For years, I've trained everyday for the Ironman competition here in Madison, WI.
I have finished in the top 1% for all of my races.
My strongest event is the bike.
My time for that specific event is comparable to some pro athletes.

## what went wrong
I realized I wasn't having fun. When I first started, it was the audacity of the entire thing that appealed to me.
I was already biking and running everyday for funsies and Ironman wasn't that much of a leap for me. 
Making the sport my lifestyle was not exactly what I had in mind.
To this day I scratch my head quite vigorously trying to figure out how I fell into it.
My best guess was the massive amounts of positive feedback I was getting from family and friends, and how I inspire them. 

## quitting
Not going to lie (or am i?!), quitting ironman was rediculasly tough for me.
I thought I was somehow letting people down that looked up to me.
Furthermore, I kind of took the event and training for it as part of my identity. 

## life after ironman
Once I decided that I was done with Ironman, I rediscovered my love for adventuring.
I now strap a backpack on and run everywhere I go, including when I travel to other cities. 
If the distance is too great, I will find a bike to use.
Furthermore, I forgot how much of a gym rat I am... 
Ironman training schedule did not have the flexibility for really solid strength training regiments. 

## conclusion
The ultimate lesson I learned is people are not stupid. 
I was not fooling anyone by thinking I was doing others favors by doing something I was not absolutely certain about.
Furthermore, I learned that I need to listen to the feedback people are giving me.
There were many warning signs before I reached full burnout.
