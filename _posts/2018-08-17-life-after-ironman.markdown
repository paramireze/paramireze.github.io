For years, I've trained everyday for the Ironman competition here in Madison, WI.
I have finished in the top 1% for all of my races.
My strongest event is the bike.
My time on the bike is comparable to many pro athletes.

## what went wrong
I realized I wasn't having fun. When I first started, it was the audacity of the entire thing that appealed to me. 
Making the sport my lifestyle was not exactly what I had in mind.
Perhaps it was the feedback I was getting from friends and family that caused me to go that direction.
For the next few years, I invested heavily in the sport.
I bought the expensive bike and gear. 
I swam every morning before work and do run/bike rides after. 
I would do long bike rides on the weekends.
All those things were enjoyable to me at first.
Overtime, it stopped being fun.
Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the health benefits and the prestige of being a competitive athlete.


## quitting
Quitting ironman was one of the toughest decisions I made.
For some reason, I thought it was who I was as a person, that it was my identity.
Strange right? It sounds silly even writing it in retro spec.
However, people would call me "Ironman" or introduce me as "Paul here has done several Ironman's".
It would often get me talking to people at work that would otherwise not have anything in common with. 

## life after ironman
Once I decided that I was done with Ironman, I instantly enjoyed running and biking again.
It no longer felt like a job. 
In fact, I am running and biking more than I ever was.
I am grateful for the years training. I believe that rigid lifestyle was the fuel for my new love of fitness freedom now. 

## conclusion
The ultimate lesson I learned from quitting ironman is I should never commit myself to something because I feel I should.
Also, my identity is something I define and no one else. 
Taking ownership of my time was the first step to a happier life.
