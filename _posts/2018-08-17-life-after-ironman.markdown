For years, I've trained everyday for the Ironman competition here in Madison, WI.
I did well for all of my races, especially for the bike event.
I never took the event too seriously and tried to have as much fun as possible.
It was not uncommon to go through 2-3 beers during the run.

## what went wrong
I was burned out by the second year. 
I didn't realize it at the time. Looking back, it seemed like almost everyone else could see it clearly and would try to let me know. 
When I first started, it was the audacity of the entire thing that appealed to me.
I was already biking and running everyday for funsies and Ironman wasn't that much of a leap for me. 
Making the sport my lifestyle was not exactly what I had in mind though although that is what happened for four years.
To this day I scratch my head quite vigorously trying to figure out how that happened.
 

## quitting
Quitting Ironman was tough for me.
I thought I was somehow letting people down, that I was an inspiration to my family and friends.
I truly thought that I was somehow hurting other people if I choose to quit competing.
It never occured to me how insulting that is to others and myself.
That perception was self induced.
However, In some sense, perhaps this is analogous to how I end up taking on roles that I did not agree to or want to be in, far as other areas of my life. 


## life after ironman
Once I decided that I was done with Ironman, I rediscovered my love for adventuring.
I now strap a backpack every morning with my gear and laptop and run wherever I am going.
I enjoy traveling and doing endurance events with friends.
My evening are sometimes spent pushing a cargo bike 12 miles to my mom's place.  

## conclusion
The ultimate lesson I learned is people are not stupid. 
I was not fooling anyone by thinking I was doing others favors by doing something I was not absolutely certain about.
Furthermore, I learned that I need to listen to the feedback people are giving me.
There were many warning signs before I reached full burnout.
