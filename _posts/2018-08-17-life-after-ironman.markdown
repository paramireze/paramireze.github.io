I remember well the moment when I was done with Ironman.
I was reading short stories by endurance athletes.
One story talked about a guy racing his first Ironman sometime in the 80's.
He knew very little about the event and borrowed some crappy bike to race with.
The event was very unstructured and would sometimes take people days to finish.
He would stop at restaurants and sleep at a hotel.
He was congratulated by a cardboard sign at the finish line 24 hours later.
I thought to myself, I will never have that cool of a story to tell doing the same things each year.
That is when I announced that I was done with Ironman.


# Life After Ironman
Being an "Ironman" was my identity.
People would call me ironman, and still do.
For that reason, I think it is why it took me so long to move on.
Once I removed the pressure of feeling like I had to train, I was able to start enjoy running and biking again.
I am biking and running more than I ever have.
