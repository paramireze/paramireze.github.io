This exercise of blogging about my spendings has some surprising results. 
For one, I no longer think saving more money is always better, or realistic.
In fact, I am starting to notice that there are healthy spending habits that are not always immediately clear.

## Unexpected expenses

# a sudden end

My world of warcraft playing, football sports nut of a nephew died at 25. 
He had a rough life battling illness his entire life. He was not dealt a fair hand.
Thank you for keeping me sane during the holidays and jamming out on games with me.

``` 
Arrangements: $103.00

# going away party

Dakota, my co-worker, decided to find a better job. 
Being that he is a cool guy, I bought a lot of booze for everyone at the bars. 

```
Night out: $78.25

## bank bump

sold my time trail bike to a friend for a discounted price.  
I did not subtract the $ I received from the bike from my total for this month's spendings.
