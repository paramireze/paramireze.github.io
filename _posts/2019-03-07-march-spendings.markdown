I am not sure I like the word "Frugal". For me, spending less money is about being conservative in your behaviors and in your thoughts. It is about looking at each micro decision and seeing how the consequences of those decisions can impact your ability to make decisions later. I guess, I like to think of spending less as being less impulsive. Otherwise, I don't think a person has a chance to sustainably reduce their spending in the long term. 

With all that said, I was very impulsive for a good two week stretch. It sort of snuck up on me. Something I like to think about is how I define my definition of fun. For some reason, fun means going out with friends and not much else. My goal is to redefine what fun means to me so that staying home on a friday reading a book is just that.
