I do not believe using discipline to save money or lose weight is the right way to think of making change. Instead, I like to think that disciple is a temporary tool to help form new habits. There needs to be some reward system to replace the need for discipline. For example, I've read a lot about the benefits of intermittent fasting. So instead of eating three meals a day, I will have one big meal instead. Not eating for 23 1/2 hours took a lot of discipline at first. However, the reduced inflammation in my legs, weight loss, better sleep, and improved focus made it easy to keep up the habit.

For the last few months, I have similarly been forming habits that involve saving money. This means not going out nearly as much as I once did. This has proven to be the toughest change in habits that I have ever faced. I spent the last 20 years going out almost every friday and saturday with friends over drinks. Sometimes I will shut my phone off on Fridays, knowing that I may cave into peer pressure. Not easy indeed. 

As a reward system to replace my alcohol fueled tendencies, I have been taking online-courses, exercising more frequently, and bragging about it through this blog site. When I am struggling, I find that looking at my progress over the months has been a huge motivator.
