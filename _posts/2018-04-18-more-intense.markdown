I am growing an appreciation how nice having intenses are. You take common tasks such as opening a website, a map or simply sharing text (like a url) and make it streamline. 

Even though I find the syntax a bit overwelming, the documentation is there. I had no trouble copy and pasting the text to make things work. Yes Bryan, I copy and paste! sue me.
