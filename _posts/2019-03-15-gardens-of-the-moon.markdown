Gardens of the Moon is about a war taking place between a human empire trying to take over the continent of Genebackis. The story is told through the eyes of some of the key characters that are in the malazan army or people in the cities that are under siege that will play a key role how things play out. 

The main character is a Sorceress named Tattersail. She is a tragic character who has the poor misfortune of surviving many battles only to see everyone close to her die. She shows an amazing amount of strength and vulnerability at the same time. Her abilities in sorcery is equal to the Malazan Army's High Mage Tayschrenn. 

Empress Laseen leads the Malazan empires. She rose to power by overthrowing the former leader. She is a master of deception which makes her a formidble opponent to the opposing armies. The Empress wears a shadowy cloak of deception, figuratively speaking, and a mystery to the reader. The information I did get was rumors discussed between the characters throughout the book.

I think what makes this book truly special is how you see these crazy war tactics play out. The intentions of the Malazan army is never obvious and has shown time again and again that they are a relentless force, willing to sacrifice many of their solders.

# Final Thoughts
Steven Erikson's Malazan series is on the scale of Game of Thrones far as character development and plot twists. There are a dozen or so characters that the reader experiences this story through, each with a personality that is completely different and believable. It really feels like some of those characters are my friends and I feel sad and happy when they do.
