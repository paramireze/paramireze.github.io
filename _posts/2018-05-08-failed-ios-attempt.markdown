I downloaded an IPhone app hoping to get a development environment set up. Nothing works and I feel silly. It all started during a meeting yesterday. Someone asked we make some updates to a IOS app that we support. However, our mobile developer no longer works with us. So, me laying in bed last night imagined myself showing up to the coffee shop early this morning and single handedly knocking it out myself.

No, i do not have ios experience. I have never created any mobile apps. I don't know what I expected. I sit here now laughing at how rediculas the entire thing is. Not going to quit trying though. At least not yet. I am far too stubborn for that. 

For me to move forward, I will need to figure out how to get the project to build and display on the emulator.
