In this article, I will be paraphrasing and summerizing an article given to me by my project manager titled "[10 powerful strategies for breaking down User Stories in Scrum (with cheatsheet)]({{ 'https://medium.com/the-liberators/10-powerful-strategies-for-breaking-down-user-stories-in-scrum-with-cheatsheet-2cd9aae7d0eb' }})"

A key part of an agile workflow is breaking down tasks into sprints. A sprint is typically made up of user stories


User stories should describe functional changes and not technical.
And example of a functional story might be "button that saves the report", as opposed to "add javascript that will send an ajax to save the report in mysql database"

Being able to create broken down, smaller user stores help prevent unexpected delays from technical issues.
It also creates a more well defined list of goals to achieve.
For that reason, an experienced scrum team will look for ways to refine their user stories and often "on the fly".
