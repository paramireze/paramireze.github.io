Learnin Philips Informatics Analytics platform has been fun. They use different technologies that solve different problems. More specifically, they set out to solve healthcare problems using healthcare specific solutions. 

Developing a new application from scratch is done mostly using ruby rails. I say mostly because there is some java technologies that is also being used. More specifically, Philips provides a SDK that has both a ruby gem and hibernate for data modeling. 

I was told the harbinger SDK provides three major components

- datamodeling using hibernate
- data connections using javascript
- app development using ruby gem, including some custom helper functions that are specific for SSO, context integration and real time messaging
