# Running Bear Triathlon
This is the second year of the `Running Bear` triathlon.
  
I won last year and look to take a second victory.

The course is similar to a sprint triathlon.
The order of events is bike -> run -> swim.
I was told the bike route is 9 miles, 5k run, and 200 meter swim. 
About 7 of the 9 mile bike route was laid with fresh blacktop.
It felt like I was riding on butter.

# Weapon of Choice

I once again choose Trek ion pro road bike. 
I thought it did well given that most of the route is pavement and smooth blacktop.
Bit of gravel at the end, however, the time gained from riding on blacktop made up for it.

# Run & Swim

I had a strong lead going into the run and spent the last mile slowing down my breathing for the swim.
The technique worked well and I was able to swim easily to my second victory.

For being a gangster, I was awarded a giant teddy bear and a cowboy hat.


# Three Lakes

I spent a bit of time exploring the `three lakes` area on bike. Beautiful area with a lot of wildlife.
