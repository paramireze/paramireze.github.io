# Running Bear Triathlon
This is the second year this event has taken place. 
I won last year and found myself up against more competetors this year than last.

An unusual bike->run->swim triathlon, as opposed to swim->bike->run


# Weapon of Choice
![finish]({{ '/assets/images/2018/aug/trek-ion-pro.jpg' }})

I once again choose to use my Trek ion pro 2011 road bike for this course. 
I thought it did well given that 95% of the route is smooth blacktop.
Bit of gravel which felt more like cyclocross racing than anything but the time gained from riding on blacktop made up for it.

Won the first place prize for the second time.
For my efforts, I was awarded a giant teddy bear and a cowboy hat.
Most of the competitors today were fairly inexperienced and looking to have fun.

# Three Lakes

I spent a bit of time exploring the `three lakes` area on bike. Beautiful area with a lot of wildlife.
