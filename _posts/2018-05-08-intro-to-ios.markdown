## Intro 

I know what you're thinking. What the hell happened to android? well, that is a tough question to answer. Basically, my workplace has an ios app that is currently unsupported and see an excellent opportunity to learn mobile development, contribute to work, and impress some folks. Hopefully I don't need to take the recommended month long training program to get the updates I need to make changes to the work application. 

These initial lessons are quick and will be covering a lot of ground. First, since this is my first time working with swift, lets discuss what swift is. According to apple's swift page, 

> Swift is a powerful and intuitive programming language for macOS, iOS, watchOS and tvOS. Writing Swift code is interactive and fun, the syntax is concise yet expressive, and Swift includes modern features developers love. Swift code is safe by design, yet also produces software that runs lightning-fast.

The first thing I have noticed is there are no semi-colons. yay!
