I know what you're thinking. What the hell happened to android? Hey what the hell did hpapen to android? Didn't I just spend the last two months following a series of tutorials learning views, layouts, preferences, shared resources, multi threading with async and async loader?

To answer the question, my workplace has an ios app that is currently unsupported. This provides me with an excellent opportunity to learn mobile development, contribute to work, and earn some mobile developer cool points. Hopefully I don't need to take the recommended month long training program to get the updates I need to make changes to the work application. 

## first set of lessons - intro to xcode and swift 

These initial lessons are quick and will be covering a lot of ground. First, since this is my first time working with swift, lets discuss what swift is. According to apple's swift page, 

> Swift is a powerful and intuitive programming language for macOS, iOS, watchOS and tvOS. Writing Swift code is interactive and fun, the syntax is concise yet expressive, and Swift includes modern features developers love. Swift code is safe by design, yet also produces software that runs lightning-fast.

The first thing I have noticed is there are no semi-colons. yay!
