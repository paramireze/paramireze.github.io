The beer mile is hosted by the madison hash house harriers and it is one of my favorite events.
Lot of people spectated to watch the gruesome race known as the beer mile.
There were three race categories; wine mile, relay, and beer mile.

# my plan
I won last year and look to take my second victory. 
Some guys showed up that seemed in good condition.
I knew I would need to rely on my drinking skills if I were to take the win.
For that reason, I made sure to not run hard and keep taking slow even breaths to best handle downing beer.

For the first two laps, there were three of us competing for the lead. 
One of the competing runners could not handle a stomach full of beer and it was just myself and one other person running.
Although we were running side by side before going into the final lap, I felt I had the race won.
My strategy of reserving energy was working well for me and felt strong after downing my final beer to run the last 1/4 mile.

The race was won and earned myself a pabst trophy can.
I proceeded to celebrate my victory in my friends hottub shortly after.
