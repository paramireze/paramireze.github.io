Tampa is approximately 80 miles south west of Orlando, connected by the I-4 interstate. Tampa borders the gulf of Mexico and is known as an estuary, a place that the saline levels are between that of sea and fresh water. To the south is Fort Meyer and an residential island Boca Grande. IF youcontinue south, you will eventually run into the everglades and the florida keyshowever, that is well over 300 miles away. 

It seems Florida has a super popular governor named Rick Scott. He is in every since a scott walker when it comes to politics, including rejecting federal funding for high speed rail systems. 

I will be visiting my cousin in hillsborough county. It is the fourth most populated county in florida. The economy there is primarily driven by trade, transportation, business. Strawberries is their #1 agriculture money maker.

According to the hillsborough county wiki page, the are is primarily democratic leaning.
