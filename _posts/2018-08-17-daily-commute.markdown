For me, Ironman wasn't about competing.
It was more of a "Huh, Wonder if I could I do that".
That part of my life is now over.
The one thing I miss about it is the support I got from my friends.
I wish I could enjoy the event more since it seems to inspire others.

I like to bike and run religiously and I also find that I can put the same effort into anything I try to accomplish.

I will sometimes put in 5 - 9 miles a day run commuting.
I can do more than that on the weekends.

When there aren't [explosions]("https://www.channel3000.com/news/video-shows-blast-from-deadly-sun-prairie-explosion/774088877") and [gun shots]("http://www.wkow.com/story/38473338/2018/06/Wednesday/shots-fired-at-sun-prairie-apartment-building"), Sun Prairie (a.k.a Gangster Prairidise;) is a fun place to hang out.
I like to hang out with mum for dinner most nights and play yahtzee.

# What is next?
This is a question that my friends sometimes ask me. 
My goal will be to attend racing events that my friends are going to. 
That way I can use the experience as an excuse to travel and hangout since I am not a competitive person and couldn't care less about placing or whatnot.
