Ironman was something I did as a reward for myself for all the hard work I put in far as overall health. 
That part of my life is over now and find that I was ready to be done with it. 
Training for ironman really helped reinforce my identity as someone who enjoys being active.
It helped shape the habits that I use today. 
I like to bike and run religiously and I also find that I can put the same effort into anything I try to accomplish.

I will often put in 5 - 9 miles a day run commuting, depending on where I go. 
At a minimum, I am run commuting to and from work most days of the week.

When there aren't [explosions]("https://www.channel3000.com/news/video-shows-blast-from-deadly-sun-prairie-explosion/774088877") and [gun shots]("http://www.wkow.com/story/38473338/2018/06/Wednesday/shots-fired-at-sun-prairie-apartment-building"), Sun Prairie (a.k.a Gangster Prairidise;) is a fun place to hang out.
I like to hang out with mum for dinner most nights and play yahtzee.
