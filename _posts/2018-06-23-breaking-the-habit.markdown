In the book `Breaking the Habit of Being You`, author `Joe Dispenza` argues that we are addicted to our stress responses. He claims that those responses give us a rush that can feel awakening, however, it can also cause us to be addicted to our problems. A lot of these addictive behaviors can eventually turn into an identity within itself, causing a person to seek out specific problem to receive  the right stress response that fits that makes up their identity.

To solve the problem of identity and addicted stress responses, a person can try and ask themselves questions such as "How would I want to be Percieved?". Once that is establish, you can think of the different ways you can achieve that goal without immediately reacting to the physical environment. 
'

The book advocates strongly the use of meditation. Meditation can be a tool for identifying how we feel vs how we think. Feeling is for the body while thinking is for the brain. Meditation can help guide us to communicate thoughts to feelings and feelings to thoughts for a common goal such as happiness. Once we are able to communicate thoughts and feelings, you can establish a baseline for your emotions that is independant from the immediate environment. Ultimately, you will change your reality far as who you are as a person. Our brains have shown that new neuro pathways are created all the time. 

The author lays out how the brain operates on different wave lengths, from High Beta through Delta. Developing children start from the lower end of frequencies and work their way up as they reach adulthood. The author claims that as awake adults, we can strive to reach higher brain waves such as alpha (learning mind) and maybe theta (between awake and dreaming). The author claims that through his methods, a person can become aware of which wave someone is on through practice in meditation. 
 
The author discusses the different brain waves. He claims that as an adult, we can familiarize ourselves with the different waves. He talks about how Meditation can be used to limit input from the external world while increasing our awareness of the internal.
