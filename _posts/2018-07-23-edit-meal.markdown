The next step to making a fully functional crud app is adding edit functionality to the.
I will need to allow the user to open an edit/details page when a specific review is tapped.

![segue]({{ '/assets/ios/july/create_segue.png' }})

# step 1: - add the `Show Detail` segue
In XCode, this is done using control - drag from the `MealTableViewCell` -> `NewMeal` view controller scene

# step 2: - pass meal thru segue
in the `MealTableViewController`.`Prepare()` method, add conditional logic that checks which segue is clicked using
 `segue.identifier` property. If a review was selected, then pass that data into the segue

# step 3: - populate edit form
In `MealViewController`, you can check if a meal object was passed from the segue.
If one was, assign the meal properties to the form fields on the edit page.

# step 4: - redirect and update the review
Once the user saves their edits, a meal object will be passed back to the `unwindToMealList` method in `MealTableViewController`.
I then update the meal object and reload that row.
