I have reached a point where I can no longer move forward in my learning until I sort out a few things. The Philips AI tutorials talks about `Entities` and `EntityManagers`. I have no clue what either of those things are so in this post I will discuss my findings

# Class, Objects, and Entities: what's the difference?

According to stackoverflow, a `class` is a template for creating objects

`Objects` are a bundle of data that is packaged with functions that act on that data (called methods)

`Entities` is an object that represents something that has an identity that the system is interested in such as customers and/or accounts. `Entities` are annotated as an `Entity`.  Also, `Entities` represent a table in a relational database, and each entity represents a row in that table.
