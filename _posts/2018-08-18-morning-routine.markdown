My current favorite workout is using the stairmaster while carrying dumbbells.
I will rotate through a few exercises to get a full body workout.

## the workout

For 20 - 30 mins, I will do each exercise in 1 minute intervals using 20lb dumbbells.

- [1min] hold dumbbells at side like a wheelbarrel
- [1min] place dumbbells center on your chest and hold 
- [1min] overhead presses
- [1min] hold dumbbells just above each knee and do leg lifts

It does not take long to get an insane workout in doing this. 

# Sweet Potato Pancake

Gotta treat yourself after working hard.
Here's one of my favorites.

- 1 microwaved sweet potato
- bit of butter
- two eggs
- strawberries
- avocado
- salt & pepper

BOOM! that is how you start your day.
