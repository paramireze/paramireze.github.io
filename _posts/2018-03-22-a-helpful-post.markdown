Warning: I watched a lot of MASH as a kid. You've been warned! <br />Much like a combat medic, I triage the worst cases first. I do not get the luxury of working in ideal conditions or finding out if the soldior lived after I have finished operating. No my friend, that is not my job. My job is to work with thetools I have available and see if I can save a life here and there. Time is not my friend. I do not know what my day will look like. There is no atta boy or good job where I work. There is only the next patient. always pushing forward through an endless tasklist that could ultimately crush the spirits of lesser men. I have seen fellow hardened combat medic programmers who caved to such conditions. They went on to find jobs in more sane conditions. I on the other hand have been able to thrive in the choas this far.
