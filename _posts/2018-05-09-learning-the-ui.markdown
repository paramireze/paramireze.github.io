In this lesson, we use `XCodes` object library to drag and drop a button. We then set the background through the attributer editor on the right side of the IDE. These concepts are straight forward and important and may be a bit dull for those who are knowlegable of UI design.

### auto layout
We are able to position elements on the page using constraints. Once defined, weare then able to control how the element is positioned and sized on different devices. We are able to create constraints by clicking the `add a constraint` button while the element is highlighted. 

### Johny Ive
Johny Ive is the senior vice president of technology and design for Apple. He is a british designer who works is also the Chancellor of the Royal College of Art in London. He worked closely with Steve Jobs many years ago and was a major influence on the Macbook design. 

Some other notable of Johny's is his Apple Store design in New York City which is made of plexiglass and Durable Cable. Johny was heavily influenced by german industrial designer Dieter Rams who is known for less but better design philosophy.
