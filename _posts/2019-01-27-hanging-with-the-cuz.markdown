I have been looking for opportunities to travel and spend time with family.
I travelled to Tampa to hang out with my cousin Tumoyia.
It was an extended weekend, the plan being to attend Gaspirilla Pirate Festival.


## staying strong
Staying strong is always a priority and visit the local gym regularly.
It is located a mile a little over a mile away and enjoy the short jog over since it is just that much more time in the florida sun.

I was originally planning on taking it easy, however, the opposite could not be more true.
My workouts increased in intensity and in volume. Something about visiting a different gym motivated me to push it extra hard.

## fooding

Sushi is a thing in my cuzun household. I use to stay away from the stuff until my shellfish allergy went away.

I also like to fry up veggies using olive oil and pouch eggs on top.

## activities

Nintendo switch and pandemic


## other routes

I spent a lot of time soaking up the sun and enjoying the fact that is negative zero back in wisconsin.
