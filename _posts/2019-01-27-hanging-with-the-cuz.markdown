For the second time in my adult life, I descend upon Tampa to hang out with family.

## Gasparilla
Got to participate in the third largest festival in north america.

## Staying Strong
I visited a military gym near McDill Airforce base.
The soldiers there inspired me to work extra hard

Each day I did something like:
- 40 mins row machine
- 40 mins bike station 
- 40 minutes stair master with 45 lb weighted vest
- dozen sets of burpees with 15lb dumbbells
- dozen sets of pullups, dips and single armed pushups. 

I would than descend upon an all you can eat restaurant and put them to the test.

## Running!

I spent a lot of time soaking up the sun and enjoying the fact that is negative zero back in wisconsin.

## Conclusion

I found my visit to Tampa to be an amazing experience of spending time and discovering new things.
There is a large military presence here which was my career in my early to mid 20's.
I got to reunite with my other cousin who I hadn't seen in 30 years.
