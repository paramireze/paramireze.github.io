For the second time in my adult life, I descend upon Tampa to hang out with family.

## Gasparilla
Got to participate in the third largest festival in north america.

## Staying Strong
I visited a military gym near McDill Airforce base.
The soldiers there inspired me to work extra hard

In one day I did
- 40 mins row machine
- 40 mins bike station 
- 40 minutes stair master with 45 lb weighted vest
- dozen sets of burpees with 15lb dumbbells
- dozen sets of pullups, dips and single armed pushups. 

At the end of day, I went to an all you can eat restaurant and devoured as much as I possibly could

## Running!

I spent a lot of time soaking up the sun and enjoying the fact that is negative zero back in wisconsin.

## Conclusion

I found my visit to Tampa to be an amazing experience of spending time and discovering new things.
There is a large military presence here which brings me a bit back to my early 20's.
Also, I was able to meet my cousin for the first time in 30 years.
