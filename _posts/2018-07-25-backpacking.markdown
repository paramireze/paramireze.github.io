For the last 18 months I have run commuted to anywhere I had to go within a 5 mile distance. I ran to work, friends, stores, coffee shops, and the gym.
My backpack is falling apart and got a new one.

## gear
![New Backpack]({{ "/assets/images/2018/july/new-backpack.jpg" }})

I usually carry my laptop, clean shirt/shorts, deodorant, sunscreen, snacks, and whatever random things I want to bring with me. My backpack usually weighs somewhere around 20lb's if I had to guess. 

## inspiration
I was inspired to run commute after injuring myself from training too much for Ironman.  
I tore the connective muscles in my knees where it attaches to the tendon.
I was doing 12 mile runs every other day.
My theory was I could prevent myself from getting injured by breaking up my runs into shorter distances with rest between.

## changes I have noticed
My shoulders are extra tough. 
I can hold two 30lb weights in my hands for over 30 minutes without too much problem.
