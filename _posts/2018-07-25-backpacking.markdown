For the last year I have run commuted almost every day.
I get a sense of pleasure knowing that I ran to work or where ever I happen to be going.
Who wants to mess with the guy who runs everywhere he goes? ;)  

## My Commute Gear

I got this a week ago to replace my other backpack. 
It is an upgrade for me far as comfort, straps, pockets, and how it sits on my back.
I like that I can fit a lot of stuff in this bag and the straps cinch everything down nicely. 

I usually carry my laptop, clean clothes, deodorant, sunscreen, snacks, and whatever random thing that I happen to want to bring with me.

I may have took "born to run" a bit too seriously. 
I ran my first marathon barefoot with a time of 3h 30m at the Haunted Hustle in 2012.
I have since dialed it back and usually wear vapor gloves. 
Yes, I did own a pair of vibram five fingers. 
Vapor gloves are just as good imo.
They are thin enough that i can roll them up and fit them in my pocket and strong enough to endure many many miles of running.

## inspiration
I was inspired to run commute after injuring myself from training too much for Ironman.
I tore the connective muscles in my knees where it attaches to the tendon.
My theory was I could prevent myself from getting injured by breaking up my runs into shorter distances.  
At one point, I was running 12 mile around Lake Monona everyday. 

Things have been good. No injuries since transitioning to run commuting. 
I think the shorter runs allow me to focus more on my form since I am take breaks and not dealing with extreme exhaustion. 

## who should run commute
Anyone who has showers at work ;)
