For the last 18 months I have run commuted, usually wearing a 15 - 20lb backpack. 
I run to work, visit friends, nearby stores, coffee shops, gym, anywhere within 5 miles.
My backpack is falling apart and got a new one.
I usually carry my laptop, clean shirt/shorts, deodorant, sunscreen, snacks, and whatever random things I want to bring with me.

This is a backpack given to me when I registered for 2016 ironman. It is designed for running and has a chest and waist strap. 
After 18 months of use, the waist strap tore at the seem and the other straps are close to doing the same

I got this a week ago to replace my other backpack and happy with it.
The waist and chest strap work well and hold the backpack snugly in place.
There are other straps that will cinch down the contents of the bag to prevent items from moving around. 
The bag also has a strong, rigid support where my back comes in contact with the bag.  
This is especially important for comfort.
Finally, my back doesn't get nearly as sweaty as my last bag did. 
I think part of the design is to allow air to travel more easily.

I may have took "born to run" a bit too seriously. 
I ran my first marathon barefoot with a time of 3h 30m at the Haunted Hustle in 2012.
I have since dialed it back and usually wear vaporgloves. 
They are thin enough that i can roll them up and fit them in my pocket. 
They are strong enough to endure many miles of running. 

## inspiration
I was inspired to run commute after injuring myself from training too much for Ironman.  
I tore the connective muscles in my knees where it attaches to the tendon.
I was doing 12 mile runs every other day.
My theory was I could prevent myself from getting injured by breaking up my runs into shorter distances.
The thought being I could still put in a lot of miles with more rest. 
Also, shorter runs would allow me to focus on my form since I am not dealing with the extreme exhaustion that comes from running long distances. 

## changes I have noticed
I have not had any knee or ankle issues. 
My back and shoulders are extra tough and rarely experience in soreness, pain or fatigue in those areas.
