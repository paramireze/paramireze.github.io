I have been run commuting almost everyday for the last year.
Most run commutes are within 5 miles and add anywhere 10 - 30 minutes to my commute time. 
Since my running is broken up throughout the day, it makes for more frequent, shorter runs that allows me to recover more quickly.

## My Commute Gear

I got this a week ago to replace my other backpack.

I usually carry my laptop, clean clothes, deodorant, sunscreen, snacks, and whatever random thing that I happen to want to bring with me.

I have been running in minimalist shoes for about a decade now. 
I am of the opinion that heel striking will destroy your knees and hips.
To solve this issue, I land mid-foot with each step.
Also, mid/fore-foot landing helps strengthen my feet, ankles, and calves since a lot of energy is absorbing/stabilizing your weight.

When things get nasty, I have these bad boys to keep me up right. They are great when trudging through snow.

## conclusion

Run commuting has a lot of hidden benefits.
I talk to passerbyer's at times.
My shoulders are tougher.
My stress levels seem to be much improved.
Most importantly, I feel like a bad-ass.
