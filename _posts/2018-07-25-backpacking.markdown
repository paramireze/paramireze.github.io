For the last year I have run commuted almost every day.
I get a sense of pleasure knowing that I ran to work or where ever I happen to be going.
Who wants to mess with the guy who runs everywhere he goes? ;)  

## My Commute Gear

I got this a week ago to replace my other backpack. 
I didn't realize how much nicer a hiking/running backpack is for run commuting.
I usually carry my laptop, clean clothes, deodorant, sunscreen, snacks, and whatever random thing that I happen to want to bring with me.

I have been running in minimalist shoes for about a decade now. 
It always made sense to me that less support equals more foot strength.

I lug these guys around when things get nasty out and need traction.


## inspiration
Why would anyone seek to take more time to get where they are going only to be stinky and sore?
That is a great question.
Since my run commute to work is  3.5 miles, I am losing very little time running to work.
