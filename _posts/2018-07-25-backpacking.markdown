For the last 18 months I have run commuted every chance I got.

It was sometime around two and a half years ago that I injured myself pretty badly from running too much training for ironman. 
I tore the connective muscles from my knees where it attaches to the ligements.
I spent six months being very inactive and I had a lot of time to think. 
I decided that I needed to run shorter distances with more time inbetween to rest in order to prevent myself from getting injured.
