Good morning. Take a deep breath in. Feel the sensations on your skin, back, neck, arms. Roll your shoulders back, adjust your hips forward,tilt your head back and point your gaze slightly downward. Good, you are now aligned. Say "you're welcome" to your older self because that person is thanking you. I should know, I am a older self than previous me's. 20 years of hardcore gaming addiction has made my shoulders and hips set in ways that are unnatural. I spend much of my time trying to undo the damage of bad hibitual habits from my youth. I know what you're thinking. You're only 36 (almost 37), you are no where near old. Fine, true. whatever. I feel old. My body is sore. My thoughts feel old. I have trouble being fascinated with the world as I once did. I could be the first case of someone dying young of old age. I joke but not really. I do feel old in the sense I am thinking about my past self as a distant memory. I have switched gears. I conserve and plan for the long wait. 

I bet you are wondering what any of this has to do with a tech blog. Well, I have no idea. There are no rules here. Fine, the old bait and switch. You came here to learn about software development, or at the least a different perspective. Instead, you hear the rantings of a young old guy. I am not apologetic. I am not sorry nor do I feel bad. I feel nothing. I feel stuck here in time expressing ideas that I didn't know existed until I wrote it down. Software development does that for me too. There is a strange silence in my mind after coding one of the various pet project apps I have. None of which are close to being complete. I start over frequently and sometimes just enjoy the act of coding more than completing some project. I consider it keeping the tools sharp so I can more quickly adjust to the movements of coding.
