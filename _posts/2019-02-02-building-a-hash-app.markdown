I figure the best way to have fun was to sit at a coffee shop on my weekends building a silly app for drunk people.
There is surprisingly a lot of work anytime you make even the simplest iPhone apps and feel proud of myself for seeing this through.

## conclusion
Overall, building this app was a lot of fun.
Most my time was spent in starbucks on the square.
For whatever reason, the employees there take in all the homeless in the cold winter mornings and I love how grateful everyone seems.
That and it's on the square which has a fantastic view of the capitol building.
