Building a raunchy app made for drunk people to sing silly songs is not an easy thing.
For those unaccustomed to hashing, it is basically a drinking club that has singing involved.
Unfortunately, sometimes the members have a tough time remembering the words to the songs hence this app.

## not easy
There is actually very little coding involved when building iPhone apps. 
Most of the work is in the layout, and design using a interface builder.
Those double arrows, song title, hash icons, and all the other stuff takes a lot of work.
The reason being is you have to design the layout for vertical and horizontal view.
Basically, you have to design the same app twice for both.

## the solution
what I thought was going to take a day or two of work, actually took two or three weeks. 
For one, I needed to style the app and add more functionality other than just the song themselves.


![Table View]({{ '/assets/images/2019/feb/hash_table.png' }})
![Table View]({{ '/assets/images/2019/feb/hash_song.png' }})

Adding the hash calendar was a desparate attempt at adding enough functionality as to pass code review.

## conclusion
Overall, building this app was a lot of fun.
Most my time was spent in starbucks on the square.
It is my favorite coffee shop the only reason being is the culture there which is mostly consistent of homeless.
I like the fact that in the winter, the homeless are allowed to occupy many of the seats to stay warm, while the homeless shelters kick them out in the early mornings.
