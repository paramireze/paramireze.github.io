Madison is a great place to live if you are into biking.
There is a network of bike paths that allow you to reach most area's.
The city has recently won platinum level status for investing so heavily in their bike infrastructure.

When I first went vehicleless about 5 years ago, the decision was mostly financial since I was in school and accruing debt.
Getting rid of my vehicle meant I had and extra 3 - 4k a year which translated to more time out at the bars with my buddies.

I have since done well for myself far as employment and have no desire to buy a vehicle.

I am a bike commuter through and through.
Many think I am crazy for biking year around, including through the Wisconsin winters.
Well, I think everyone else is crazy for not biking all the time :)


Madison is the fifth city to achieve platinum status for having quality bike infrastructure.
