Most of my commuting is done thru running or cycling. 
I have been without a vehicle for the last 5 years.
Winters have proven to be a challenge.
Telling people that I don't have a vehicle is challenging too.
I am not completely impervious to the opinions of others.
I try to be careful of the message I send with my lifestyle choices.

{% highlight ruby %}
- "No I don't need a ride".
- "No I don't need money". 
- "yes, I choose to live this way" :)
{% endhighlight %}


Much of my life choices are modeled after those who have inspired me.
There is a community of cyclist who enjoy going on weekend adventures such as bike camping.
My favorite is the disco party in the elroy sparta bike tunnel.
People would load up disco equipment on their cargo bikes and party away

I find that I am starting to move away from others bike adventure events and starting my own.
For example, I like to bike to the wisconsin river for a tubing event. 
Another ride is out to Mount Horeb to compete in a mountain bike race.
  
There is a certain freedom to cycling that is hard to explain. 
I feel I have much more control over my experience. 
It is not hard for me to perform basic maintenance that ensures some reliability.
I can't control the weather but I can avoid bad drivers.
Madison has many bike paths that I enjoy. 

One of my primary goals when going vehicleless was to be more active.
Having a vehicle made it easy to come up with excuses whenever it rained or snowed.
Wisconsin has gnarly winters and who wants to deal with that?
However, I hated being inactive more than I did the Wisconsin weather.

I will buy or lease a car when it makes sense for me. 
I believe I have good habits when it comes to avoiding procrastion and wouldn't sacrifice my activeness, if I did have a vehicle.
