Most of my commuting is done thru running or cycling. 
I have been without a vehicle for the last 5 years.
Winters have proven to be a challenge.
Telling people that I don't have a vehicle is challenging too.
I am not completely impervious to the opinions of others.
I try to be careful of the message I send with my lifestyle choices.

{% highlight ruby %}
- "No I don't need a ride".
- "yes, I choose to live this way"
- "No I don't need money, but I will take it ;)". 
{% endhighlight %}


Much of my life choices are modeled after those who have inspired me.
There is a community of cyclist who enjoy going on weekend adventures such as bike camping.
My favorite is the disco party in the elroy sparta bike tunnel.
A few riders will bring disco equipment on cargo bikes and we will party into the night.

I am starting some of my own bike adventures.
For example, I like to bike to the wisconsin river for a tubing event. 
Another ride is out to Mount Horeb to compete in a mountain bike race.
I eventually would like to do some bike touring when I am able to work remotely.
  
There is a certain freedom from cycling. 
I feel I have much more control over my experience. 
The winters are a bit gnarly and can be challenging.
However, it is the same type of challenge when skiing or snowmobiling. 
I can't control the weather but I can avoid bad drivers.
Madison has many bike paths that I enjoy. 

Being vehicleless has taught me some valuable skills. 
I am great at bike repair and maintenance. 
I have some top of the line cold weather gear.
I am a much stronger person both mentally and physically.
