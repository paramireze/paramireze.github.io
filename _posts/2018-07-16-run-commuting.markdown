Madison is a great place to live if you are into biking.
There is a network of paths and trail systems that give you peaceful access to many parts of southern Wisconsin.
The city has recently won platinum level status for investing so heavily in their bike infrastructure.

When I first went vehicleless about 5 years ago, the decision was mostly financial since I was in school and accruing debt.
Getting rid of my vehicle meant I was able to spend more time with my friends since I was saving an and extra 3 - 4k a year.

When I had my truck, I had trouble motivating myself to do riding that didn't involve perfect conditions.
Raining? better drive. Cold outside? better drive. 
Getting rid of my truck simplified things a great deal.
The question was no longer "how do I get there?". Instead it became "what investments do I need to make things suck less?". 
You invest in good gear and you can usually stay fairly okay far as comfort goes. 
Not ideal, but not terrible.
