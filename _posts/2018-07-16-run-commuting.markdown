Madison is a great place to live if you are into biking.
There is a network of paths and trail systems that give you peaceful access to many parts of southern Wisconsin.
The city has recently won platinum level status for investing so heavily in their bike infrastructure.

Getting rid of my truck was one of the best decisions I have ever made. 
It creates a challenge which I work hard to overcome and when successful, is a source of confidence and happiness for me.
