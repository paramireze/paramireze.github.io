Madison is a great place to live if you are into biking.
There is a network of bike paths and trail systems that give you peaceful access to many parts of southern Wisconsin.
The city has recently won platinum level status for investing so heavily in their bike infrastructure.

When I first went vehicleless about 5 years ago, the decision was mostly financial since I was in school and accruing debt.
Getting rid of my vehicle meant I was able to spend more time with my friends since I was saving an and extra 3 - 4k a year.

When I had my truck, I never could motivate myself to do long adventure rides.
It was the "well I could drive" thought that usually won out when decision time came.  
Getting rid of my truck simplified things a great deal.
The question no longer was how do I get there?
It turned into "how far do and how long do I want to go?" "how much beer can this bag fit?" or "can I fit a boombox on the handlebars or do I need to duct tape it to the rack?" ;)
