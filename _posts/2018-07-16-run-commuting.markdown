Madison is a great place to live if you are into biking.
There is a network of bike paths and trail systems that give you peaceful access to many parts of southern Wisconsin.
The city has recently won platinum level status for investing so heavily in their bike infrastructure.

When I first went vehicleless about 5 years ago, the decision was mostly financial since I was in school and accruing debt.
Getting rid of my vehicle meant I was able to spend more time with my friends since I was saving an and extra 3 - 4k a year.

At first it was a financial decision to go vehicleless.
Despite having a good job with my loans paid off, I could never imagine owning a vehicle unless it absolutely made sense for me such as a long commute to work.
To me, a vehicle is a lot of responsbility.
Not that I don't want or can't handle responsibility. 
More like, I rather not have responsibility unless it is something I feel meaningful to me.
Getting rid of my vehicle felt much like getting out of a bad relationship.

If you follow some of my blog articles under `Adventuring` you might get a sense of the extreme changes to my lifestyle.
