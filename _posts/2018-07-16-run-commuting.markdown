# Me today
I bike about 20 - 40 miles almost everyday. 
It doesn't matter if its smoldering hot or a brutal icy Wisconsin day. 
I am officially a crazy cyclist person with a bike for every occasion. 

# How things went down
I wasn't always this way. 
It all started about 5 years ago when I sold my truck. Well, it broke down and I had it scrapped. 
I tell people I sold it because I don't want to beg the question "why not sell?". 
When I decided to scrap my vehicle, there was no rational thought behind it. 
It was like a quick shot of adrenalin mixed with a bit of fuck it. 
It was entirely in the moment snap decision just like all major life decisions should be. 

For starters, I must acknowledge that I am a single adult male whose only responsibility is making sure I get to work on time. 
Not saying I wouldn't have made the same decision if I had kids. 
Just the decision wasn't all that hard for me to make.
Getting rid of my truck felt like getting out of a bad relationship. 
All the stress that comes with driving and paying to keep the aging vehicle alive was gone.
