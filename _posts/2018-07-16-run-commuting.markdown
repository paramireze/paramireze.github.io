It all started about 5 years ago when I sold my truck. Well, it broke down and I had it scrapped. I tell people I sold it because I don't want to raise the question "why not sell?". When I decided to scrap my vehicle, there was no rational thought behind it. It was like a quick shot of adrenalin mixed with a bit of fuck it. It was entirely in the moment snap decision. If I slowed down to think about it, it would have never happened. 

Getting rid of my truck felt like getting out of a bad relationship. What surprised me most was I never felt hurried or in a rush.

Funny thing is, I enjoy driving more now than I ever have. There are occasions when I will rent a vehicle or drive for a friend. I like that I no longer have to comprimise when it comes to driving. I am going into it purely for the fun of it.
