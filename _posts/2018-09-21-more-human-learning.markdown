# ID3 Algorithm
is a way to build decision trees from a dataset.
It will then iterate over every attribute and select a decision tree with the lowest entropy.

# Restriction Bias
I believe this is when you limit your attributes or function to a specific type of function such as a quadriatic equation. 

# Preference Bias


## Refresher Concepts

# Logarithms
Logarithms are a convenient way of expressing large numbers.
 

{% highlight ruby %}

log2(8) = 3
2x2x2 = 8

log5(625) = 4
5x5x5x5 = 625

{% endhighlight %}
