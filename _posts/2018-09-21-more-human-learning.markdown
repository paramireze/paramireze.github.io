# ID3 Algorithm
is a way to build decision trees from a dataset.
It will then iterate over every attribute and select a decision tree with the lowest entropy.

# Restriction Bias
Bawsed on the order of the hypothesis searched.

# Preference Bias
because `ID3` takes a top down approach, it will prefer good splits at the top. 
This also means that it will prefer shorter trees over longer ones.


## Refresher Concepts

# Logarithms
Logarithms are a convenient way of expressing large numbers.

log2(8) = 3
2x2x2 = 8

log5(625) = 4
5x5x5x5 = 625
