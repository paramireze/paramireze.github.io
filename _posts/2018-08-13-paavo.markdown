For the last 20 or so years, The Hash House Harriers has a tradition of going to hurley wisconsin, getting drunk, and then running the paavo marathon the next morning.
This year was no exception.
After a 5 hour drive, we hit silver st and hit up some of the many bars in this once prosperous mining town.
The night is finished at the strip clubs, a hallmark of a successful pubcrawl since they are located on the far end of the street. 

## Race Day

I ran this years marathon with `OTC`, `Jeff Daniels`, and `Paging`.
We ran together at a leisurely pace and drank beer along the way.

# North Pole Bar at Mile 23

The route is beautiful for the most part except the final 5 mile stretch on highway 51. 
Lucky for us, there is a few bars and stopped to have a refreshment.
