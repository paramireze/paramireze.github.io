I spent three days traveling to northern Wisconsin to compete in a marathon and a sprint triathlon.

## Friday
Drove 5 hours to Hurley Wisconsin from Madison. 
Biked around for a bit 

## Saturday
For the last few years I have been running the `Paavo Nurmi Marathon` with the hash house harriers.
I do not worry about time and find other people to run with. 
We will frequent a bar on hwy 51 as a reprieve from the hot sun.

After the Marathon we travel to three lakes where one of the Hashers has a cabin on the lake.
I enjoyed swimming in the calm clean waters of the north.
