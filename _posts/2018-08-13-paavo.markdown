I spent three days traveling to northern Wisconsin to compete in a marathon and a sprint triathlon.



## Friday
Drove 5 hours to Hurley Wisconsin from Madison. 
Biked around for a bit 

## Saturday
For the last few years I have been running the `Paavo Nurmi Marathon` with the hash house harriers.
I do not worry about time and find other people to run with. 
We will frequent a bar on hwy 51 as a reprieve from the hot sun.

After the Marathon we travel to three lakes where one of the Hashers has a cabin on the lake.
I enjoyed swimming in the calm clean waters of the north.

## Sunday
I got out on an early bike ride to explore the three lakes area. 
The early morning loons make a hypnotic call that made it feel I was on some alien planet.  
I found out that many deer will use the roads for travel when there are cars not around.  
They would wait until I was about 50 feet away before darting off into the woods.

I once again choose to use my Trek ion pro 2011 road bike for this course. 
I thought it did well given that 95% of the route is smooth blacktop.
Bit of gravel which felt more like cyclocross racing than anything.

Won the first place prize for the second time.
For my efforts, I was awarded a giant teddy bear and a cowboy hat.
Most of the competitors today were here for their first time to learn the sport. 
I was grateful I got to hang out and have fun.
