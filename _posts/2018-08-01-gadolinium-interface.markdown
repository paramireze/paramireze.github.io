This is my first attempt to build the interface for viewing the gadolinium calculator. 
I used all stackviews which will make the controls highly adaptable to any device.
I will need to customize the button and the text at the bottom to display more cleanly. 

Overall, I am satisfied that this will be enough to get me started on working on logic to handle calculations.
