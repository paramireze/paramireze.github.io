As a newly Senior Developer, I was tasked to build a large clinical application for the Radiology Department.

It was no easy task and involved learning an entirly new language and framework provided by a software vendor.

## What went right
The software vendor was great. They had existing normalized datamodels and well documented procedures for doing common tasks with healthcare data.
Also, I got to work with stakeholders who were highly invested in the project, making my job very clear from the beginning on what stories to tackle first

## What went wrong
The department is completely bi-passing any automation and code refinement steps to make the application more sustainable.
As of now, anyone using the system will have to go line by line of my code to figure things out. 
The overhead will continue to grow as other developers implement their own coding.

## What I think went wrong
Developers in the Radiology department are not consulted. 
All high level technical decisions are made in closed door rooms and instrucitons are later passed down to the developers with zero room for input.
The department does not understand how investing early in a project can bring them much more in return later.
Instead, it is clear to me the department rather get a partially complete product and have the developers start on the next project.

## Moving forward

It will be my goal to communicate long term project success by following through with all the additional steps.
As arduous as this sounds, the payoff will be a better software team that is more able to do its job well.
