Today we work more with constraint layout. We are able to position UI elements in relative position to one another. For example, we set up constraints for a label by adding a constraint from the label to the button. That way I am able to control the layout no matter the device. 

So far, all our buttons and labels have been done using Apple's `UI Kit`. UI kit provides preconfigured UI elements to allow developers to create a UI quickly.

While working with `Interface Builder` you are able to see filled in circles in the XCode IDE, next to the line number, which indicates that an action is mapped to a UI element.

`IBOutlet` is the code that interacts with the UI
`IBInput` logic that executes after triggering an event

My favorite quote from this exercise

> In programming, you have to keep the attitude of a child. You have to be willing to experiment and to try new things.
