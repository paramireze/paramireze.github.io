Something I have been doing lately is eating one meal a day. It saves me having to think about it. It also frees me up to put all my energy into cooking one meal, ableit, it's a big meal. I think the real reason why I do it is because I like it. I like stuffing myself full with delicious food and wanting nothing other than a good book for the rest of the night.
