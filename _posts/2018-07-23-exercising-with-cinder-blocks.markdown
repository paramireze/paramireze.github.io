I did not have access to my gym today so I improvised.
I was visiting someone at UW Hospital and wanted to get a quick workout in.
I biked to lakeshore path.
The route has various fitness equipment for pullups, situps, dip bars, and other equipment.

## Pull-ups & Dips

I used this station to do four sets of pullups and dips. When doing pull-ups, I like to do slow movements and hold myself in position when reaching the top of the pullup. I also added crunches in between sets.

## Cinder Block Overhead Lunges

Across from the pullup/dip station, I found a 20-30lb cinder block located by the UW Marching band practice field. I did weighted overhead lunges with the cinder block. I did 20 yards for each set.

## Overhead Lift

This image isn't quite right but it was the closest one I could find to the workout I did. I would set the cinder block on the ground and grip it like I am about to do a deadlift. I would then lift and thrust the weight overhead making sure to to drive with my legs and hips while bracing the core as much as possible.

## Burpees & Run
I finished my workout with burpees and run. I did four sets of ten burpees and a lap around the marching band field between each set.
