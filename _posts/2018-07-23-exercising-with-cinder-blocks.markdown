I did not have access to my gym today so I improvised. 
Getting in a workout everyday is something important to me and will make up workouts if I have to.

## Pull-ups & Dips

I used this station to do four sets of pullups and dips. When doing pull-ups, I like to do slow movements and hold myself in position when reaching the top of the pullup. I also added crunches in between sets.

## Cinder Block Overhead Lunges

Across from the pullup/dip station, I found a nice sized cinder block located by the UW Marching band practice field. 
I held the cinder block overhead while doing lunges for 15 - 20 yards per set. 
I find that single leg workouts like lunges are ideal to prevent muscle imbalances in developing your legs.

## Overhead Lift

This image isn't quite right but it was the closest one I could find to the workout I did.
I like to do visualizations techniques in my workouts and imagined I was throwing bails of hay. 
I made sure to brace my core and protect my lower back as best as possible.

## Burpees & Run
Burpees are especially nice if you do not have workout equipment.
For that reason, it is one of my favorite workouts.
I did four sets of ten burpees and would then run a lap around a small area in the field.
