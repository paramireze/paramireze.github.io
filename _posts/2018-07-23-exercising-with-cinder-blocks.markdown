For today's excercise, I biked down University of Wisconsin's lakeshore path along what is called `Fitness Path`.
The route has various fitness equipment for pullups, situps, dip bars, and other equipment.

## Pull-ups & Dips

I used this station to do four sets of pullups and dips. I also did crunches in between sets.


## Cinder Block Overhead Lunges

Across from the pullup/dip station is the UW Marching band field. It was there I would do weighted overhead lunges using a cindor block I found nearby. I would lunge for 20 yards for four sets.

## Hay bale toss exercise
I just made up the name `hay bale toss exercise` and sure there is an official name out there somewhere. Basically, I like to pretend I am picking up a bale of hay from the ground and tossing it overhead (without releasing).
Instead of a hay bale, I used the 20-30lb cinder block. I like this exercise because it combines a lot of movements into one. I try to drive with my legs and hips and brace the core as much as possible.

## Burpees & Run
I finished my workout with burpees and sprints. I did four sets of ten burpees and a lap around the marching band field between each set.
