Traveling is a new experience for me.
I never really had the income to justify doing it for any length of time.
There is something special about removing yourself from your life. 
It can be a bit hard coming
You are able to see more clearly how that environment is impacting you.

With that said, San Francisco is freaking cool. People are chill, relaxed and friendly. 
The city is beautiful and the streets are alive. 
The beer tastes good and they have great foods.

I also got to hang out with someone I only seen once in the last 7 years. Yay me!
