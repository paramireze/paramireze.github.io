Traveling is a new experience for me.
There is something special about removing yourself from your enviroment and going back to it. 
You are able to see more clearly how that environment is impacting you.

With that said, San Francisco is freaking cool. People are chill, relaxed and friendly. 
The city is beautiful and the streets are alive. 
The beer tastes good and they have great foods.

I also got to hang out with someone I only seen once in the last 7 years. Yay me!
