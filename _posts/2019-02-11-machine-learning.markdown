Something I have wanted to do for quite a while but didn't have the time for was taking classes to learn Machine Learning.
Now that I am done with some other projects, i am ready to take this on

I watched a few of a series of `coursera` videos on machine learning. To begin with, they went over the formal definition of what machine learning is.

 ```A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.```
 
The first concept taught is `supervised learning` and the difference between a `classification problem` and a `regression` problem.

`Regression` problem is when you try to predict a response

`classification` is identifying group membership
