Well, I just finished my SIIM conference in San Francisco to the Machine Learning Conference. 
I feel like an idiot for not getting into machine learning sooner. 
The impact the technology is going to have is probably equally as important as the introduction of the internet. 
It will change the way we think about data and increase our ability automate processes

I will be going over `Udacity's` Machine Learning Video's

# Quantitative Analysis
A way of analysing something using complex mathmatical and statistical modeling. 

# Supervised Learning
Is when you try to find a geralized rule for one value input and when applied to the other data inputs, it is true
This is also has to do with approximation

- classification

- regression
 

# Unsupervised Classifications
when you have a set of inputs and need to categorize/classify it to make it useful.

# reinforced learning
using both supervised and unsupervised learning

# function approximation
You have a non-linear input and output and use a function that most closely describes the behavior.
