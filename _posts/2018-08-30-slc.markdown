I spent 5 days hanging out with my friend from Utah. 
I put my electronics away and spent the entire time exploring the area and hanging out with my friends.
It was interesting exploring some of the mountainy trails.
The culture there is strongly tied to the mormon religion.
My friend recommended that I buy `Under the banner of Heaven` book, and I did.

It was weird leaving SLC and going back to Madison.
For some reason it was tough for me to adjust. 
Suppose I wasn't clear what I should do when I get back.
