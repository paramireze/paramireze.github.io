Did I say learning Android is hard? Well, for me this is especially true. I have worked with Java before, however, not a whole lot. This is also the first mobile tutorial I have taken too. Lot of learning curves thrown at me. 

I do find that I struggle understanding how the different files relate to one another. In this exercise, we created a child activity. I learned that a child activity is useful when extending functionality. 
![Parent Child Activity Diagram]({{ "/assets/images/2018/jan-june/ParentChildActivityDiagram.jpeg" }}) 
For example, we are passing form data to a new screen. We can use the child theme to pass the user input and display it. From what I can tell, this creates a separation of concern far as what the behaviors of each of the files are doing. Still learning but glad that I can think this through.
