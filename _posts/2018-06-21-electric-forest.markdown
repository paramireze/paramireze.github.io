Getting to `Electric Forest` was a bit of a challenge. Nick got off work around 4pm and we were on the road sometime around 6pm. It was a long drive and didn’t reach the festival grounds until 4am. There was some weird snafu once we got there making it so we couldn’t set up tent until 6am. Luckily for us, the sun was coming up so we could see well ;)

I can't begin to describe how incredible the festival is. There are seven stages with an all-star lineup of muscians, each of whom can draw large crowds on their own such as `Bassnectar`, `Clozee`, `Washed Out`, `Refus de Sol`, `Cheese String Incident`.

 The festival grounds is littered with beautiful structures, artwork and people. Talented dancers dressed in exotic garb can be found twirling LED lights. 

There was never a moment in any given day that people weren’t partying with music blasting. It was not uncommon for me to wake up the next morning and find hundreds of party goers that never went to sleep from the night before. I would sometimes wonder to those parties and would notice how everyone attending seemed to be completely oblivious to the world except for the music.  

## Taking Breaks
# Lake Michigan
One of the little things that makes Electric Forest special is being able to exit and reenter the fetival grounds. It is unusual and Nick and I took full advantage. We would visit a nearby beach off Lake Michigan each morning and rid ourselves of the previous days filth. Laying down listening to the waves was a good repreive from the many thousands that resided in the festival grounds. It was also nice being able to stop by a store  for fresh fruits, ice, and other goods at reasonable prices.

# Cathedral
Everytime we got back from the beach, we would play `Cathedral`, usually for a few hours since we had time to kill until the festival kicked off with some of the better artists.
