My `Electric Forest` experience kicked off on Wednesday evening. Nick and I were done with work for the week and were excited to be on the road. 

We didn’t reach the festival grounds until 4am. There was some weird snafu once we got there making it so we couldn’t set up tent until 6am. Luckily for us, the sun was coming up so we could see well ;)

Everyday, we would venture into the festival and bounce around the various stages listening to different artists perform. We did make sure to watch `Rofus De Sol`, `Bassnectar`, `Clozee`, `Washed Out`. Otherwise, we would let our ears lead the way.

Exploring the festival grounds is an experience all in its own. There are large statues that light up at night. There are paths that have thousands of lit up ornaments along it. There are talented dancers at each stage dressed in custom and sometimes twirling LED lights.

There was never a moment in any given day that people weren’t partying with music blasting. It was not uncommon for me to wake up the next morning and find hundreds of party goers that never went to sleep from the night before. I would sometimes wonder to those parties and would notice how everyone attending seemed to be completely oblivious to the world except for the music.

## Daytime Activities 
# Lake Michigan
One of the little things that makes Electric Forest special is being able to exit and reenter the fetival grounds. It is unusual and Nick and I took full advantage. We would visit a nearby beach off Lake Michigan each morning and rid ourselves of the previous days filth. Laying down listening to the waves was a good repreive from the many thousands that resided in the festival grounds. It was also nice being able to stop by a store  for fresh fruits, ice, and other goods at reasonable prices.

# Cathedral
Nick and I played `Cathedral` for hours each day. Our neighbors would often stop and watch us play. We chilled out, enjoy beer, and played to our hearts content. We are pretty evenly matched and would find ourselves constantly improving to outwit one another.
