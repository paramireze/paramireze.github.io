This year, I attended `Electric Forest`. The tickets were not cheap, however, the artists made it well worth it.
To survive the four days, i came up with a strategy.

- get sleep
- exercise
- cook good healthy food
- take time out to recharge
- party hard

I did just that. 
Each morning I went for morning runs around the parameter of the festival grounds.

# Exercise
it ws fun seeing all the after party's that never ended.
It was also fun running on some of the roads outside the place and getting away a bit.

I would also do push-ups and resistance band workouts
My camp neighbors must have thought it odd seeing me doing pushups at 7am while most everyone was knocked out or still partying.


# Cooking
I used my roommates camping stove and tried making omelets. 
It was a fail since I did not have the right type of stick free pan for it so ended up eating it scrambled.
I would also take the time to make coffee and read my book.

# Recharge

One of the little things that makes Electric Forest special is being able to exit and reenter the fetival grounds. 
My roommate and I would would visit a nearby beach off Lake Michigan each morning jump into lake michigan.
 
Once back at the festival grounds, we would play board games until it was time to enter the camp grounds

# party hardy

This is where I failed. 
I would party but not hard enough I felt like.
I was usually in bed by midnight and woke up not hung over from anything.
I guess I was too concerned about the previous steps and forgot to just go with things.

# conclusion
This event was a challenge for me and came out feeling good about how things went.
I learned a lot about what gear to get for future camping trips and how to cook using a camp stove.
