Getting to `Electric Forest` was a bit of a challenge. Nick got off work around 4pm and we were on the road sometime around 6pm. It was a long drive and didn’t reach the festival grounds until 4am. There was some weird snafu once we got there making it so we couldn’t set up tent until 6am. Luckily for us, the sun was coming up so we could see well ;)

The Festival itself is truly an amazing event. There are seven stages that have some of the most talented artists jamming out. It can be overwhelming knowing which to see. The festival grounds is littered with beautiful structures, artwork and people. Talented dancers dressed in exotic garb can be found twirling LED lights. 

There was never a moment in any given day that people weren’t partying with music blasting. It was not uncommon for me to wake up the next morning and find hundreds of party goers that never went to sleep from the night before. 

## Taking Breaks
# Lake Michigan
One of the little things that makes Electric Forest special is being able to exit and reenter the fetival grounds. It is unusual and Nick and I took full advantage. We would visit a nearby beach off Lake Michigan each morning and rid ourselves of the previous days filth. Laying down listening to the waves was a good repreive from the choatic festival grounds which thousands resided. We were able to stop by the store on the way back and buy fresh fruits, ice, and other goods at reasonable prices.

# Cathedral
Everytime we got back from the beach, we would play `Cathedral`, usually for a few hours since we had time to kill until the festival kicked off with some of the better artists.
