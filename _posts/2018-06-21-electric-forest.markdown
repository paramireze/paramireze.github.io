There are seven concert stages located throughout the festival grounds, each with their own unique personalities. There are two main stages for headliner's and the rest are a bit smaller, however, impressive none the less. 
 
There are massive statues with LED lights built into them. There are several villages made up of tents within the grounds. There are hundreds of little places to see such as huts, art gallaries, tree forts, mazes, statues. 

Some people come to this event because they believe it is a spiritual experience. They want to promote art, music and love. There are others who come here to take a break from their lives of responsibility and routine. Then there are those who want to see how annilated they can get. No matter which category you are, most everyone will party with frantic ferver. The Music has some of the best artists and the venue itself is second to none.  

I am the guy who wants to take a break from the life of work and responsibility. I realize when I take trips like these, I spin up new realities filled with routines, habits and rituals. For example, I take a morning jog, make coffee, read then write. 

I went to `Electric Forest` with my roommate Nick. He has gone a few years now and wanted to join in on the fun. Each day, we went to a low key, nearby beach. It was a nice reprieve from the festival camp grounds with the many of thousands of people. We also spent two to three hours each day playing `Cathedral`, a chess like board game.

We hung out with our neighbors a little bit. It was a group of four who would party hard. I saw their group come back to their site at 7am. They later told me they were up all night drinking with some other campers.  

Overall I thought the experience to be very positive for me. I do not identify closely with the musix oe people, however, I did find myself enjoying the camping, people seeing and overall badassory this place is. 


## Thursday 
The sun was getting ready to come up as `Nick Johnson`, my roommate, arrived at our campsite for Electric Forest. People all around us had been traveling like we had and everyone was grateful to be here. We quickly set up tent in hopes of getting a few hours of sleep before the day begins. 

It is 7am and a camp of girls is doing shots. There conversations are hilarity. There was a debate on whether anal sex is good or not. One girl made the argument that it is not clean down there. The other girl said "who cares". 

# Getting Around
Bring water everywhere you go. 

# A day time tour
I toured the festival grounds in daytime to get a feel for the place to make night time navigation easier. The forest can be particularly difficult to navigate since it is massive with a crazy amount of LED Lights in the trees, walkpaths, and the random Statue.   

# The Forest
The forest contains three different stages. There is also a massive amount of LED lights, random villages, a silent disco, and dressed in elaborate garb. I find that I can easily get disoriented while in there and will bounce around wondering. 

# Food
I decided that I would make myself pancakes each day. I bought some mix and brought some egg and butter to mix with it. However, I have not yet mastered how to make it right. It keeps crumbling on me and unable to keep its shape. 


## Friday

I overheard a woman on the phone talk about the night before. She said she had to go to the medic tent during the festival while shrooming. I overheard her say that she thinks someone's water made her get sick. 

The day started after a good night sleep. The temperature was in the low 70's with a cool breeze, making it perfect sleeping weather. I was up early and explored the mostly sleeping camp grounds. I would see reminents of the choas from before. 

After coffee, we headed to lake michigan for a swim. The water was cold but it felt great to be clean again. We hung out for a bit and hit up a convenient store to stock up on ice. It is quickly becoming tradition for us to play a few games of Cathedral before heading into the festival. We are pretty evenily matched and can be intense trying to win. 

We headed in and watched `Mt. Jay` play at the `Jubilee` stage. His music was 

## Cathedral

Having fun. I walked through the park. Everything unrecongizable. a thing beyond description. unrecognizable beauty. 

I sit here, in this nixon, writing this down. It is midnight at e-forest. I guess I don't know what the write. I been exploring my way through. I want to dance tonight.


## Saturday
I burned my fingers badly today. I was sitting next to the water station making coffee. I use a propane stove and realized that I forgot to place a tin metal piece underneath it. I should have left it alone but I didn't. Instead, I though I could lift the stove and slide the metal piece under it. As a result, some of the fuel in the stove bottom leaked out and got in the grass. In response, I quickly moved the stove onto the metal piece by grabbing one of the arms that you rest a pot on. It was not near the flame, however, it was suffiently hot enough to burn my index and thumb quite a bit. Luckily, the fluid do any harm to anything. 


Nick and I played cathedral. Our neighbor friends checked in on us. 

I could clearly hear the music from the `Jubilee` stage, which was far from my tent. The sky was lit up from the numerous spotlights from the festival. The forest inside is alive with music from the many stages throughout. Trees are littered with LED ornimants of all sorts. Hundreds of umbrellas are line up overhead as I walk through the wooded path. 

Nick and I hit up the `Silent Disco`. You wear headphones and listen to the DJ play. To the outside observer, it appears hundreds of people are dancing to silence. I put the headphones on and found myself enjoying the cleverness of it all. I would sometimes take my headphones off and look around. It was quite a thing. 

Once past the forest, you are on a hill with more stages. The stars hang low as I peer out into the clearings within the clouds. 

We headed to the beach. The day was hotter than the yesterday. Lot more people were at the beach. I jumped inand swam for a bit. It was tough due to the big waves. The drive to and from the beach is nice. It is good to leave the festival grounds and move around a bit. 

## Sunday
I woke up early on Sunday. I run the parameter and along some roads for a morning jog. Reminents of the party the day before still linger within a few hard party goers. Two such crowds were still listening to music and dancing just outside my tent at 6am. I have been where they are now. I am 37 and have tried to defeat sleep. It never works. 

I make coffee for the first time today and read my book in the passenger side of the rental car. I put my feet up and transfer in and out of sleep. There is some life around here and there. After an hour of reading and napping, i decide to move around. I hear music playing off in the distance and go to find the source. On the opposite side of the camp grounds, a car has an insane stereo system set up and is blasting jams. I am the only hanging out near the car while everyone else is probably asleep. Amazing how easy it is to sleep despite absolute choas going on around. 

The gates to the festival grounds open up. I jog from one end to the other just to get the lay of the land. Very few people in their since there isn't really anything going on other than shops opening up and sound checks. I hit up the slack line village and look around the forest for a bit. Otherwise, it was a nice jog on the cloud covered day. 
I use the porty potty and I can clearly hear a woman puking in the stall next to me. She is dry heaving and wonder if she had bad drugs or food. 

There is a bit of frustration tonight. I wanted to dance, and get l ost in the music. I was not able to. It was okay though, I still felt great. Just not into the dancing as much as I have in the past. 

Nick and I met up around noon and headed to the beach. There was a light drizzle. We had the place pretty much to ourselves. He told me about how he use to go to lake superior in his hometown and go to the beach. The water was always too cold and no one ever went in for any length of time. He seems guninely drawn to the beach, including the one here which is nothing like the beaches in Tampa. 

We played Cathedral. We continually go back and forth in our victories. most our neighbors left. It is Sunday and not everyone will be staying over night. I drink beer and play. Nick will smoke and have a beer. Our neighbors sold us some molly. Our moods improved as we anticipated the good time. We stayed a few games longer and made way to the festival grounds. 

The place is packed. It can be tough navigating through the masses. We listen to a set at the Forest stage. They are playing some house music. Then we head to `Jubilee` then hanger. Sherlock stage had an insane number of people

We watched 





The tripolee stage was insane. I looked over the crowd from far back on higher ground. Before me was a sea of people dancing. I tried my best to join them. Entranced I was from the dark lite fiery night. 

The walk home was nothing but i  

The best way to describe `Electric Forest` is to compare it to the movie `Avatar`. The place is alive with lights, monuments, hierglaphy's, and all sorts o
