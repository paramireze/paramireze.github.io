# Midnight Tides - Book 5 of the Malazan book of the Fallen Series

The story of Midnight Tides is centered around a cursed sword. 
The Fallen God (the Crippled God) had a legendary blacksmith craft the cursed sword so he could subjugate the wielder to his will. The Warlock King, leader of the Tiste Edur people (Non-human elder race), knew of this sword and sent four warriors to retrieve it.
However, the four warriors were engaged in combat as they found the sword and a young ambitious warrior named Rhulad, out of desparation, used the sword to fight off the would be attackers.
Rhulad would not survive the attack but the remaining warriors did.


The three warriors believing their lives at risk decided to leave the body behind to make haste.
However, none of the warriors could pry the sword from Rhulad's hand. 
Maiming a warrior was seen as taboo, so instead they carried Rhulad back with them.
Shortly after returning to their tribe, Rhulad came back to life.
His death and return was painful beyond measure and his mind was torn.
But otherwise, the sword gave him additional physical strength and skill.
The tribemen witness his return in all his agony screams, and feared him greatly.
Rhulad having his new strength and power usurped the Warlock King for leadership and declared himself Emperor.
At the time, it seemed the Warlock King stepped down because he dared not oppose Rhulad. 
However, it is later discovered that the Warlock King and the Crippled God planned for this to happen all along.
The Warlock King merely feigned wanting the sword for himself as to create the necessary conditions for Rhulad unwittingly carry out the cripple god's will.
Because Rhulad was now seen as a god after returning to life, the people committed to serving him absolutely.
That is something the Warlock King could never have done given the Tiste Edur for the most part are peaceful.
Rhulad will then declare war on the Letherii people (humans) to the south.

There is a lot of history between the Tiste Edur and the Letherii people. The Letherii is a civilization that worships the coin and 
believes in a sort of manifest destiny. The Tiste Edur believed it was a matter of time until the letherii would declare all out war on them for control over resources. 
So it wasn't hard for Rhulad to militerize all the tribes for a seemingly rightous cause when in reality, this was all a ploy while the Warlock King and the Crippled God pulled the strings.

The story of the Tiste Edur is a sad one. After the Warlock King is usurped, their traditions and values started to be comprimised. 
The identity of the Tiste Edur was being dismantled by Rhulad and his billigerance towards traditions that were held sacred. 
Furthermore, during battles, the warlock king would unleash choatic magic instead of Kurald Emurlahn (magic belonging to their god father shadow). 
In one battle, the Warlock King unleashed vortexes upon the Letherii defenses and those columns would strip the flesh from each soldier and fill the sky with bone and armor. 
The battle field was described as raining bone and armor and not a drop of blood could be found. 
By all standards of the Tiste Edur tradition, this was as far from an honorable battle and left them all deeply scarred.

There are a lot of other stories that a less central to what I have just described.
The Gods that are playing behind the scenes in this war align to an over arching story that span across the 10 novel series.
