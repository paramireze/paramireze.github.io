## Hello friends

The story of Midnight Tides is about a war between the Tiste Edur (gray skinned humans) and the Letherii (humans). Disclaimer, to those who are malazan nerds, I apologize 
The story reminds me much of the movie Avatar where you have an indigionous species that is aspected with nature and 
the Letherii are greedy humans looking to exploit the Tiste Edur's abundant resources. Far as the analogy goes, that is about it. 
The Tiste Edur fall victim to a fallen god named the Crippled God. He fashions a cursed sword that will ultimately destroy
the Tiste
