I read an interesting article about `transhumanism` and some of the philosophical arguments for the human capacity to achieve happiness or reduce suffering. The `transhumanist` philosophy makes a strong argument for moral obligations and it is interesting to see a discussion, especially in the age of rapid population/technological growth.

@todo: finish writing this
