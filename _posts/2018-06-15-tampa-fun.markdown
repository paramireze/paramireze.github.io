The thing I like most about Tampa is the low hanging clouds that roll across the horizon at any given point.

## Saturday 
Saturday was spent traveling from Madison to Tampa. I met my cousin Tumoyia outside the airport entrance. We had not met in person in 30 years and we spent the ride catching up. 

Our first destination is a spanish restaurant called `Acroiris`. I ordered the Palomilla Steak and Plantanos Maduros (fried plantains). I would later make some for funsiez. 

## Sunday
It was my first morning in Tampa and went for a morning jog to explore the neighborhood. I got to take my time and soak in the atmosphere as I jogged. I was fascinated by the plant life, especially the tropical trees and the St. Augustine grass. 

Breakfast consisted of a Bacon, Egg, Veggie Frittata made by my cuz. She skillfully used a cast iron pan on the stove top and then in the oven.

That morning I got to meet Tumoyia's husband Jason. He works for the city of St. Pete as a fire fighter. He is also a fitness enthusiast who enjoys video games, meaning we had nothing in common ;)
  
# Caddy's Beach 
My most gracious hosts decided that my first day in tampa should be spent drinking good alcohol while sitting on some sand. They took me to `Caddy's on the Beach` which resided on the Gulf of Mexico in `St. Petersburg`.

Once we ordered our drinks, we headed off into the waters to sit on a nearby sand bar. We chilled out and sat on a nearby sandbar. Every few seconds a wave would crash into our backs, keeping us cool during the mid-day summer weather.   

The Beach Life brings all sorts of people. I was fascinated by the occassional Beefcake that patrolled the beach while brandishing dark leathery tanned skin and long sun-bleached stringy hair, resembling the WWF wrestlers that I idoloized back in the 80's.

# John's Pass
We made our way to a beautiful boardwalk village called `John's Pass`. The place seemed like a playground for tourist and locals alike. There was plenty of spots for boaters to dock and grab a drink.   

We stopped at `The Hut Bar and Grill`. The inside had a hawaiian theme going and I enjoyed a couple craft beers from the local brewery.

On the way home, we stopped at `Nico's` food truck and experience my first ever `cachapa` which tasted like a cheese filled pancake with Chicken. Yup, that awesome.

 
## Monday
The day started with Tumoyia cooking breakfast for everyone. She showed me how to make omelets which I would later do myself. She cooked up some bacon as a side and served some `bullet proof coffee`. Basically, you make normal coffee and blend it with butter and coconut oil.  

The day was chill. I stopped at Tumoyia's gym down the road from her and picked up a week long pass. I enjoyed the mile long jog each day to get warmed. It was refreshing having a new route added to my years of running. I would sometimes wake up early enough to see all the crazy colors that reflected from the clouds from a sunrise. 

Tumoyia and I went to `Liborios` restaurant where I ordered pulled chicken, yellow rice, and tostones (toasted plantains). I paid a little over $10 and it lasted me three meals. I know for sure my friends would be envious of the spanish restaurants here in Tampa.

# Fortnite
We decided to switch things up and stay in to play video games. Tumoyia has a switch and was destroying some octopus monster on the moon playing Mario. I was busy getting shot in the face a lot trying to play `Fortnite`. Jason and I took turns so I didn't completely decimate his KDR.

## Tuesday
# Weeki Wachee Springs
We traveled north of Tampa to hang out at the `Weeki Wachee Springs`. Visiting fresh water Springs in Florida during the summer is the Wisconsin equivalent of hitting up a sauna during the winter. When not enjoying the cool waters, there were lots of picnic areas that allowed visitors to bring in food and drinks. 

I survived the terrifying `cannonball slide`. A woman let loose a bone chilling scream before crashing into the waters. The slide sent me soaring through a dark tunnel and into the cold springs. If someone says they were not terrified their first time down, then they are f**king lyers :). 

![Weeki Wachee]({{ '/assets/images/tampa/weeki.jpg' }})

We also enjoyed a rendition of the `Little Mermaid` in an underground theater which peared into the springs. The actors played out the story of the little mermaid using a pre-recorded audio/music track. They swam infront of us and at times would venture out on the stage inside the theater for the on-land parts.

The night ended like any night should with video games. Jason and I took turns playing `Fortnite`. I was getting more comfortable switching weapons and building ramps to get around. I still had a hard time living after being shot in the face a few times ;) 

## Wednesday

# A Not so Secluded Beach
Tumoyia and I set out to watch the sunset from `Cyprus Point Park`. It was once a low key spot only known to the locals, however, we discovered that there was quite the crowd with questionable character. Nevertheless, we walked the sands and enjoyed the sunset together as cousins reunited. 

![Cyprus Park]({{ '/assets/images/tampa/cyprus_park.png' }})

There was all sorts of creatures that occupied the beach. I smiled as hundreds of tiny crabs scurried away as I walked towards them. My satisfaction quickly came to an end when an army of sandflies started to feast on me. I tried my best to squash their forces, however, I was greatly outnumbered and retreated.

# Tampa at Night
Tumoyia and I headed downtown and strolled down the newly built `Riverwalk` on the `Hillsborogough River`. We had a good view of many of the downtown buildings, including the University of Tampa campus. 

![Riverwalk]({{ '/assets/images/tampa/river_walk.jpg' }})

# Hixon Park
Our walk downtown ventured to `Hixon Park` where concerts are sometimes held. The park is bordered by the Childrens museum and the Sykes building. Tumoyia showed me the `Tampa Theatre` and the `Taco bus`.

## Friday
I joined Tumoyia as she walked over to her neighbor Tonya's house for their early morning run. Tonya's three month old dog butch met us at the door with tail wags and excitment. We returned Butche's greeting in kind with belly rubs and ear scratches. 

After everyones morning workout, breakfast was had and I helped make some Plantono Maduras for the first time. I fried the plantain slices until browned in coconut oil. Tumoyia made an


We had plans to meet Tumoyia's friend Andrea out for food and drinks later in the evening. To kill time, we headed to `St. Pete's` to do some site seeing. We traveled down the Tampa I-275 and went over the `Howard Frankland Bridge`. 

For the evening festivities, the fun having took place at the `Green Lemon` near downtown Tampa. Tumoyia and I sat outside for a bit waiting for a table and noticed the Mural `You are Beautiful` written on the side of the building. Me being the master of observation noticed that it strongly resembled that of the one in Madison.

## The River walk
I was lucky enough to spend an evening with my cousin walking down the riverwalk that runs along the hillsborough river, downtown Tampa. I enjoyed staring out across the University of Miama and some of the bigger buildings owned by the news companies. There was a river taxi that pedestrians could hop on and cyclist that can easily manuever there way through.

## John's Pass
After spending a day at the beach, my most gracious hosts and I set out for `John's Pass`. John's Pass is a labyrinth of shops, restaurants, bars, boats along a large boardwalk.

#Monday
## Weeki Wachee Spring
In Wisconsin, we have Sauna's and hot tubs to keep us warm in the winters. In Florida, they have cold water springs that keep them cool in the summer. We visited one such spring. Touching the waters would instantly cover your skin in goose bumps.I could feel the the soreness/inflammation in my legs go away as the waters temporarly numbed my pain. 

![Weeki Wachee]({{ '/assets/images/tampa/weeki.jpg' }})

We also enjoyed a rendition of the `Little Mermaid` put on by live actors. The theater was underground with a window into the spring. Actors, dressed in mermaid suits swam before us as music played from the speakers around us. I cried, I laughed, I channeled my hatred at the stupid wicked witch who cursed Ariel. Eventually, love won out and defeated the evil witch. Bravo!

## Once Upon a Fortnight

#Tuesday

## Another Cousin
We traveled north of Tampa to visit my cousin Andrew. He was a big musculer guy with a friendly, sleepy bear look about him. I stood on his porch and met his two beautiful kids before being invited inside. The kids danced for us doing a jig from a character in `Fortnight`. 

## Armature Works 
The Armature Works is a renovated factory turned into a spacious market place for restaurants, bars, smoothy and coffee shops. The building is located downtown along the shoreline, up and across from the University of Tampa. 

It was difficult deciding on what to order since there was a variety of restaurants. I was tempted to order a Ropa Vieja at a spanish place and went with a avacodo egg salad instead at Graze's restaurant.

# Wednesday
## Uncle George
I visited my uncle who resided in an assisted living home near a VA. He has a passion for drawing and painting and his walls were filled with his work. We sat down and spoke for the first time in 30 years. He has a gentle voice and an unwavering smile

## Hixon Park

Just off the riverwalk was the newly built Curtis Hixon park, named after a former Tampa Mayor who died in office. The 8 acre park spans from the shoreline and well into downtown Tampa along side the children museum and across the street from the Sykes tower. Palm trees are lit up with lights as well as other features. I have been told that it is not uncommon for concerts to take place in the park and other festivities.

#Thursday
Thursday was chill for the most part. Jason worked a 24 hour shift and I came home to a freshly painted wall. We were glad that we could make his life a bit easier especially since he was not able to get time off of work. 


We played Fortnight and Jason managed to drop a grenade on some poor soul's head. We both celebrated his victory with cheers.


My cousin made me a blueberry pancake with eggs. We went to

## Another Fortnight of Fortnight

#Friday

Tumoyia and I made some eggs and plantonos for breakfast. It was my first time making Plantanos. We went to `St. Pete's` to hang out and site see for a bit before meeting her friend out for drinks.  

Tumoyia and I  with my cousin's long time friend Andrea. Andrea is extremely spanish and is a dance club veteran. She loves conversations, dancing and drinks. The three of us met up at `Green Lemon` restaurant where we enjoyed fries and margaritas. 

After eating some fries and enjoying a couple of Sangrias, we headed down the street to `SOHO Bar`. The wall opened up along the street and you could see the two bars and large dance floor inside. I ordered a `First Dive` beer and eventually a `Funky Budha`. Both were mildly strong IPA's from the local brewery's.
