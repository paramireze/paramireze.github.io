I enjoyed the skyline at any given point when in Tampa. There is always an armada of low hanging cumulonimbus clouds rolling across the horizon. On occasion, one of those clouds will blow up and reach high into the stratosphere.

# Saturday 
Most my Saturday was spent traveling from Madison -> Chicago -> Tampa. My cousin Tumoyia picked me up from Tampa airport and we were reunited for the first time in 30 years. 

My flight was delayed a few times and managed to create quite the appetite. Tumoyia brought me to an authentic cuban restaurant called `Acroiris`. I ordered the Palomilla Steak and Plantanos Maduros (fried plantains). I enjoyed the Plantains so much that Tumoyia and I would later make some at home. 

# Sunday
I woke up early and went for a morning jog to explore the neighborhood. I was fascinated by the plant life, especially the tropical trees and the St. Augustine grass. 

Tumoyia made a bacon, egg and veggie frittata for breakfast using a cast iron pan on the stove top and then the oven. She is smart about using quality ingredients that promote health such as organic and glutten free products. 

That morning I got to meet Tumoyia's husband Jason. He is a fitness junkie who loves anything nutrition and exercise related. I learned a lot from our conversations and have since adjusted my diet and exercise routines.
 
## Caddy's Beach 
We headed off to the coastal city of `St. Pete's`. We stopped at a place called `Caddy's` beach and enjoyed the gulf of Mexico. The three of us sat on a nearby sandbar, enjoying our drinks while waves washed over our backs and chest. I was intrigued by the many types of people, especially the occassional Beefcake that patrolled the beach wearing dark leathery tanned skin and long bleached stringy hair. They reminded me of the WWF wrestlers that I once idoloized back in the 80's. 

We eventually made our way to a beautiful boardwalk village called `John's Pass`. The place was a playground for tourists and locals. I thought it was cool how people would park their boats for food and drinks.  

We stopped at `The Hut Bar and Grill`. The inside of the place was truly a site and enjoyed the local craft brew beer.

## The River walk
I was lucky enough to spend an evening with my cousin walking down the riverwalk that runs along the hillsborough river, downtown Tampa. I enjoyed staring out across the University of Miama and some of the bigger buildings owned by the news companies. There was a river taxi that pedestrians could hop on and cyclist that can easily manuever there way through.

## John's Pass
After spending a day at the beach, my most gracious hosts and I set out for `John's Pass`. John's Pass is a labyrinth of shops, restaurants, bars, boats along a large boardwalk.

#Monday
## Weeki Wachee Spring
In Wisconsin, we have Sauna's and hot tubs to keep us warm in the winters. In Florida, they have cold water springs that keep them cool in the summer. We visited one such spring. Touching the waters would instantly cover your skin in goose bumps.I could feel the the soreness/inflammation in my legs go away as the waters temporarly numbed my pain.

We also enjoyed a rendition of the `Little Mermaid` put on by live actors. The theater was underground with a window into the spring. Actors, dressed in mermaid suits swam before us as music played from the speakers around us. I cried, I laughed, I channeled my hatred at the stupid wicked witch who cursed Ariel. Eventually, love won out and defeated the evil witch. Bravo!

## Once Upon a Fortnight

#Tuesday

## Another Cousin
We traveled north of Tampa to visit my cousin Andrew. He was a big musculer guy with a friendly, sleepy bear look about him. I stood on his porch and met his two beautiful kids before being invited inside. The kids danced for us doing a jig from a character in `Fortnight`. 

## Armature Works 
The Armature Works is a renovated factory turned into a spacious market place for restaurants, bars, smoothy and coffee shops. The building is located downtown along the shoreline, up and across from the University of Tampa. 

It was difficult deciding on what to order since there was a variety of restaurants. I was tempted to order a Ropa Vieja at a spanish place and went with a avacodo egg salad instead at Graze's restaurant.

# Wednesday
## Uncle George
I visited my uncle who resided in an assisted living home near a VA. He has a passion for drawing and painting and his walls were filled with his work. We sat down and spoke for the first time in 30 years. He has a gentle voice and an unwavering smile

## Hixon Park

Just off the riverwalk was the newly built Curtis Hixon park, named after a former Tampa Mayor who died in office. The 8 acre park spans from the shoreline and well into downtown Tampa along side the children museum and across the street from the Sykes tower. Palm trees are lit up with lights as well as other features. I have been told that it is not uncommon for concerts to take place in the park and other festivities.

#Thursday
Thursday was chill for the most part. Jason worked a 24 hour shift and I came home to a freshly painted wall. We were glad that we could make his life a bit easier especially since he was not able to get time off of work. 


We played Fortnight and Jason managed to drop a grenade on some poor soul's head. We both celebrated his victory with cheers.


My cousin made me a blueberry pancake with eggs. We went to

## Another Fortnight of Fortnight

#Friday

Tumoyia and I made some eggs and plantonos for breakfast. It was my first time making Plantanos. We went to `St. Pete's` to hang out and site see for a bit before meeting her friend out for drinks.  

Tumoyia and I  with my cousin's long time friend Andrea. Andrea is extremely spanish and is a dance club veteran. She loves conversations, dancing and drinks. The three of us met up at `Green Lemon` restaurant where we enjoyed fries and margaritas. 

After eating some fries and enjoying a couple of Sangrias, we headed down the street to `SOHO Bar`. The wall opened up along the street and you could see the two bars and large dance floor inside. I ordered a `First Dive` beer and eventually a `Funky Budha`. Both were mildly strong IPA's from the local brewery's.
