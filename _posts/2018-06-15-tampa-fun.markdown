It is difficult to discuss traveling without comparing it to the differences in my daily routines from home. I guess what I struggled with most is the absence of structure from my routines. 

Traveling has also taught me that I am capable of adopting new routines quickly and I believe I have good judgement in regards to which routines I pick up. For example, my cousin and her husband are both health conscious far as living right. I was able to quickly switch to their recommended diet and my energy levels stayed quite high the entire trip.

Visiting my family in Florida has taught me that I live a very structured life. I sleep at certain times, I have rituals, patterns and other things. Traveling undoes all that and forced me to improvise quite a bit. 

## Tampa vs Madison

Tampa is a beautiful city. The design of the city seems well thought out far as building layout and roads. It definitely has traffic issues, however, that seems to be an impossible problem to solve when dealing with large cities and Tampa seems to have ways of navigating around heavy traffic if you are familar with the area.

## Culture
I found myself fascinated with Ybor City, which is a historic neighborhood in Tampa, near downtown. The night life there is vibrant. The roads are narrow and the streets are alive with activity. Their is a trolly system that runs through with many murals to see along the buildings. The community their is diverse with many types of shops and restaurants. 

## Downtown
Sound of YBor is downtown Tampa. Along the shore of the bay is bayshore blvd. Bayshore is a long stretch of road lined up with beautiful homes on one side and a scenic view of the bay on the other. There are palm trees lined up along both sides with a nice spacious walking path along the water. 

Tampa has recently added the tampa riverwalk which runs over the hillsborough river, parallel to the land. The river walk was wide enough to drive a car over and groups of people could easily get around, enjoying the scenic views. 

River taxi's would park alongside the riverwalk. I was able to clearly see the beautiful architecture that made up University of Tampa. Just off the riverwalk was the newly built Curtis Hixon park, named after a former Tampa Mayor who died in office. The 8 acre park spans from the shoreline and well into downtown Tampa along side the children museum and across the street from the Sykes tower. Palm trees are lit up with lights as well as other features. I have been told that it is not uncommon for concerts to take place in the park and other festivities.

## Happening Places
Tampa is an old city with many culture roots that can be seen in the shipyards, coast lines and the surrounding cities. Tampa is also a growing city with much to offer in the ways of trending modern culture.  

There is no shortage of entertainment
