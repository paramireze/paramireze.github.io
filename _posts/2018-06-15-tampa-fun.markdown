My write up on my week long Tampa visit to hang out with family. 

## Saturday 
# Madison -> Tampa

Saturday was spent traveling from Madison to Tampa. I was on my way to visit my cousin. I was nervous, I had not seen this person in 30 years. We met just outside the airport entrance. I got in her Mazda and started to catch up on life. She has a way of being fully engaged in a conversation that helped ease my earlier nervousness.      

Our first stop was an authentic cuban restaurant called `Acroiris`. I ordered the Palomilla Steak and Plantanos Maduros (fried plantains). We sat across from one another as she told me about my family. Some I had met as a kid and others I never knew about until then. Our family does not lack drama and wondered how she was able to come out so well. 

## Sunday
Tumoyia made us a bacon, egg, veggie Frittata that morning using a cast iron pan. Her backyard is filled with tropical trees and thick bushy grass. I stared out into that alien world and wondered if I would ever get use to it. There were always thick clouds rolling across the skyline. 

That morning I got to meet Tumoyia's husband Jason. He works for the city of St. Pete as a fire fighter. He is also a fitness enthusiast who enjoys video games, meaning we had nothing in common ;)
  
# Caddy's Beach 
My most gracious hosts decided that my first day in tampa should be spent drinking good alcohol while sitting on some sand. They took me to `Caddy's on the Beach` which resided on the Gulf of Mexico in `St. Petersburg`.

Once we ordered our drinks, we headed off into the waters to sit on a nearby sand bar. We chilled out and sat on a nearby sandbar. Every few seconds a wave would crash into our backs, keeping us cool during the mid-day summer weather.   

The Beach Life brings all sorts of people. I was fascinated by the occassional Beefcake that patrolled the beach while brandishing dark leathery tanned skin and long sun-bleached stringy hair, resembling the WWF wrestlers that I idoloized back in the 80's.

# John's Pass
We made our way to a beautiful boardwalk village called `John's Pass`. The place seemed like a playground for tourist and locals alike. There was plenty of spots for boaters to dock and grab a drink.   

We stopped at `The Hut Bar and Grill`. The inside had a hawaiian theme going and I enjoyed a couple craft beers from the local brewery.

On the way home, we stopped at `Nico's` food truck and experience my first ever `cachapa` which tasted like a cheese filled pancake with Chicken. Yup, that awesome.

 
## Monday
The day started with Tumoyia cooking breakfast for everyone. She showed me how to make omelets which I would later do myself. She cooked up some bacon as a side and served some `bullet proof coffee`. Basically, you make normal coffee and blend it with butter and coconut oil.  

The day was chill. I stopped at Tumoyia's gym down the road from her and picked up a week long pass. I enjoyed the mile long jog each day to get warmed. It was refreshing having a new route added to my years of running. I would sometimes wake up early enough to see all the crazy colors that reflected from the clouds from a sunrise. 

Tumoyia and I went to `Liborios` restaurant where I ordered pulled chicken, yellow rice, and tostones (toasted plantains). I paid a little over $10 and it lasted me three meals. I know for sure my friends would be envious of the spanish restaurants here in Tampa.

# Fortnite
We decided to switch things up and stay in to play video games. Tumoyia has a switch and was destroying some octopus monster on the moon playing Mario. I was busy getting shot in the face a lot trying to play `Fortnite`. Jason and I took turns so I didn't completely decimate his KDR.

## Tuesday
# Weeki Wachee Springs
We traveled north of Tampa to hang out at the `Weeki Wachee Springs`. Visiting fresh water Springs in Florida during the summer is the Wisconsin equivalent of hitting up a sauna during the winter. When not enjoying the cool waters, there were lots of picnic areas that allowed visitors to bring in food and drinks. 

I survived the terrifying `cannonball slide`. A woman let loose a bone chilling scream before crashing into the waters. The slide sent me soaring through a dark tunnel and into the cold springs. If someone says they were not terrified their first time down, then they are f**king lyers :).

# Little Mermaid
We watched the daily rendition of the `Little Mermaid` in an underground theater. The script was a bit different from the original story most likely to avoid copy right lawsuits was our best guess. I thought the performance to be creative but their audio equipment to be subpar. minor quip.

The night ended like any night should with video games. Jason and I took turns playing `Fortnite`. I was getting more comfortable switching weapons and building ramps to get around. I still had a hard time living after being shot in the face a few times ;) 

# Another Cuz'n 
Jason, Tumoyia and I stopped to visit my other cousin `Andrew`. He is a big guy with a gentle personality. He has a daughter and son who were practicing their jig they learned from `Fortnite`. They have two outdoor cats and two dogs. The visit was somewhat brief to avoid rushhour traffic on our way home. I was glad to have met him and his family.

# A Not so Secluded Beach
Tumoyia and I set out to watch the sunset from `Cyprus Point Park`. It was once a low key spot only known to the locals, however, we discovered that there was quite the crowd with questionable character. Nevertheless, we walked the sands and enjoyed the sunset together as cousins reunited.

There was all sorts of creatures that occupied the beach. I smiled as hundreds of tiny crabs scurried away as I walked towards them. My satisfaction quickly came to an end when an army of sandflies started to feast on me. I tried my best to squash their forces, however, I was greatly outnumbered and retreated.

# Tampa at Night
Tumoyia and I headed downtown and strolled down the newly built `Riverwalk` on the `Hillsborogough River`. We had a good view of many of the downtown buildings, including the University of Tampa campus.

# Hixon Park
Our walk downtown ventured to `Hixon Park` where concerts are sometimes held. The park is bordered by the Childrens museum and the Sykes building. Tumoyia showed me the `Tampa Theatre` and the `Taco bus`.

## Thursday
# Uncle George
I got to meet my uncle who I hadn't seen since I last saw Tumoyia. He greets me and gifts Tumoyia with a painting of Paris. The painting is appropriate considering Tumoyia had recently visited there and has since been fascinated by the place. The painting has what looks like a street with shops and the Eiffle Tower is in the distant background. My uncle life has not been easy and it shows. It has made him resiliant which can be seen from his cool calm unwavering smile.

# Armature Works
We visited a newly renovated old factory building turned into an indoor open market with restaurants, bars, and other shops. Jason, Tumoyia and I ate at `Graze` which is also in Madison. The interior was impressive far as design and overall atmosphere.

# More Fortnite!
The evening ended with more Fortnite. We both died laughing after Jason dropped some c-4 on one guy and then a grenade on another. 

## Friday
I joined Tumoyia as she walked over to her neighbor Tonya's house for their early morning run. Tonya's three month old dog butch met us at the door with tail wags and excitment. We returned Butche's greeting in kind with belly rubs and ear scratches. 

After everyones morning workout, breakfast was had and I helped make some Plantono Maduras for the first time. I fried the plantain slices until browned in coconut oil. Tumoyia made an


We had plans to meet Tumoyia's friend Andrea out for food and drinks later in the evening. To kill time, we headed to `St. Pete's` to do some site seeing. We traveled down the Tampa I-275 and went over the `Howard Frankland Bridge`. 

For the evening festivities, the fun having took place at the `Green Lemon` near downtown Tampa. Tumoyia and I sat outside for a bit waiting for a table and noticed the Mural `You are Beautiful` written on the side of the building. Me being the master of observation noticed that it strongly resembled that of the one in Madison.
