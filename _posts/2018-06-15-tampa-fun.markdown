I like the skyline at any given point when in Tampa. There is always an armada of low hanging cumulonimbus clouds rolling across the horizon. On occasion, one of those clouds will blow up and reach high into the stratosphere.

## Riverwalking on the River walk
Tampa has recently added the tampa riverwalk which runs over the hillsborough river, parallel to the land. The river walk was wide enough to drive a car over and groups of people could easily get around, enjoying the scenic views, including the University of Tampa.

## Hixon Park
Just off the riverwalk was the newly built Curtis Hixon park, named after a former Tampa Mayor who died in office. The 8 acre park spans from the shoreline and well into downtown Tampa along side the children museum and across the street from the Sykes tower. Palm trees are lit up with lights as well as other features. I have been told that it is not uncommon for concerts to take place in the park and other festivities.

### Caddy's Beach 

My most acommodating hosts brought me to the beach to enjoy a day of drinks and relaxation. The beach was somewhat crowded, however, we had little trouble finding a spot to lay our towels down near the shoreline. The water was cool and was a haven from the hot and humid weather. I sat on a nearby sandbar, enjoying an local beer while waves washed across my back. 

I was intrigued from the various walks of life that visited upon the beach life, especially the occassional Beefcake that patrolled the beach wearing dark leathery tanned skin and long hair.

### Weeki Wachee Springs
In Wisconsin, we have Sauna's and hot tubs to keep us warm in the winters. In Florida, they have cold water springs that keep them cool in the summer. We visited one such spring. Touching the waters would instantly cover your skin in goose bumps.I could feel the the soreness/inflammation in my legs go away as the waters temporarly numbed my pain.

We also enjoyed a rendition of the `Little Mermaid` put on by live actors. The theater was underground with a window into the spring. Actors, dressed in mermaid suits swam before us as music played from the speakers around us. I cried, I laughed, I channeled my hatred at the stupid wicked witch who cursed Ariel. Eventually, love won out and defeated the evil witch. Bravo!

### Armature Works 
The Armature Works is a renovated factory turned into a spacious market place for restaurants, bars, smoothy and coffee shops. The building is located downtown along the shoreline, up and across from the University of Tampa. 

It was difficult deciding on what to order since there was a variety of restaurants. I was tempted to order a Ropa Vieja at a spanish place and went with a avacodo egg salad instead at Graze's restaurant.

### Cheese Cake Factory
The Cheese Cake Factory is located on the outskirts of International Mall. Being from a small'ish city in Wisconsin, I did not realize this was a thing. There was an excellent variety of cheesecakes to select from. Almost all slices are over 1000 calories.
