When trying to lose weight, the key was identifying stress. I realized that I was an emotional eater and my eating habits (and drinking habits) were a result of external forces in my daily life. Once I started to observe my impulsivity without feeling guilt or shame, I was then able to understand why I was behaving that way.

What I found was that I was too agreeable. I would often act and behave in an agreeable manner because I was afraid of conflict. I usually go along with what other people are doing and try not to be noticed. It wasn't until I realized that being agreeable was harmful to myself, my self-esteem and identity. The biggest change I made was being comfortable saying "no". In fact, something I have noticed is that some people absolutely hate it when you tell them no, and that brings me immense pleasure when I see their face screw up after saying it. 

All this may sound obvious to many, however, I learned this late in life. I think everyone has some area of their personality that takes much more time to develop than others. For me, it was standing up for myself. For others, it might be less aggressive. 

## one meal a day
I would not suggest this diet to anyone unless they were absolutely sure they were fully committed to sticking with a diet. This is one of the toughest habits I've worked on, however, the rewards are worth it.

# A typical meal for me, ranging somewhere around 4 - 4.5k calories 

- **left**: fried potatoes, onions, steak, with 5 eggs
- **right**: rice, lintels with fried asparagus, potatoes, steak on bread/tortilla.
- **back**: oven roasted sweet peppers, brussel sprouts, and mushrooms
- **smoothy**: (spinach, avocado, water, muscle milk) x2
