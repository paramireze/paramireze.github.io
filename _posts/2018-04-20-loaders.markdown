My brain is broken. Damnit... What is up with multithreading? This last tutorialis absolutely silly. there are 23different todo's with crazy looking syntax. Once again, I need to rant a bit so I can make sense of this madness. 

# Summary
The key to android development is making the main (UI) thread as lightweight as possible. That means a developer should try to offload none UI tasks to different threads. In my latest tutorial, the best way to achieve that is through the use of loaders.

# Concepts for this lesson


`aSyncTask` is a threading library that creates a class that handles tasks and operations that need to be done in the background asyncronously. Some comments on stackoverflow recommend using `Volley`, especially if you are going to be using a restAPI

`Service` Is for background services that run for a long time.



`Loaders` supposidly similar to `AsyncTask` except it is better.
