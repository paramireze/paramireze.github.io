This book was an unexpected find. I noticed this book on the shelf at the library. I remembered someone talking about a book and think the said the word "Legion" and was curious if this was the same book or genre.

The book is about a specialist for hire named Steven. He is basically a super spy. He is the master of all and takes on jobs for who ever has the need and can afford him.

Steven has a personality of someone who is at constant conflict with what he is. He is more like a super hero. His sub-conscious is able to create people called aspects that only he can see and talk to. Each aspect is a collection of subconscious thoughts and memories that manifests itself as a person. 

Steven is hired to find a corpse that could potentially contain a deadly virus. He has to compete against bio-tech companies that are also hunting for the corpse for nefarious purposes.

## aspects

The aspects are representations of knowledge he has accumulated, stretching down into his deepest subconscious. For example, if he speed reads a book on biology, he could then create an aspect that understands the book on biology completely and extrapolate information to form idea's and thoughts. The aspect could then communicate that information back to the consciousness in basic speech. 

## my humble opinion

What makes Steven different from typical super hero types is his human qualities. Despite having many aspects that knows his subconscious, he is able to separate himself as an individual who cares deeply for each aspect and there well being. He also treats other people the same way and tries to minimize harm in every decision. People who come to know him have a profound respect for him, including this reader.
