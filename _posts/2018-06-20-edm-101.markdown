When it comes to Electronic Dance Music (EDM), there are a few things you should know

## Trap Music
According to wikipedia, `Trap is typified by double or triple-time sub-divided hi-hats, heavy, sub-bass layered kick drums from the Roland TR-808 drum machine, layered synthesizers and an overal dark, ominous or bleak atmosphere.`

Trap music originated from southern hip hop style that mixed with some dubstep.
