When it comes to Electronic Dance Music (EDM), there are a few things you should know

## Trap Music
According to wikipedia, `Trap is typified by double or triple-time sub-divided hi-hats, heavy, sub-bass layered kick drums from the Roland TR-808 drum machine, layered synthesizers and an overal dark, ominous or bleak atmosphere.`

I have no idea what any of that meant which means I should probably break things down a bit to get a better picture of what trap music is

# double or triple-time

# sub-divided hi-hats

# sub-bass layered kick drums

# Roland TR-808 drum machine
