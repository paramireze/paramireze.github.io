I started this post to discuss being single and this is my n+ attempt.
Being single is not something that I typically discuss.
When the topic is brought up in conversation, I always say that "I haven't found the right woman yet".
That is a lie. 
I only say that because most people marry and have kids and I don't want to alienate myself from everyone else.

I like women, and I like all the things that entails.
I will hook up someone on occasion.

The thing is, I find life most fulfilling when I have freedom.
Freedom to move in wild and sometime irrational directions. 
Othertimes, extended periods of routine and structure.
The most fond memories I have are when I spent extended periods of time learning new things.
In my relationships, that is usually the first thing to go is my ability to grind away at learning new things and at no fault of the person I date.
When I am in a relationship, I get fixated on just that and don't bother to do any of the other things.
