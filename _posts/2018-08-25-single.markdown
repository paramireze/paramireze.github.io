I started this post to discuss being single and this is my n+ attempt.
Being single is not something that I typically discuss.
When the topic is brought up in conversation, I always say that "I haven't found the right woman yet".
That is a lie. 
I only say that because most people marry and have kids and I don't want to alienate myself from everyone else.

I like women, and I like all the things that entails.
It was not uncommon for me to sleep with women after getting drunk at a party.
I have since dialed it  back and that doesn't happen as much as it once had.

I find the greatest moments in my life have almost always come after periods of tremendous struggle.
Being in a relationship takes that away because there is someone to stop me from making crazy dumb decisions.
However, it is those crazy dumb decisions that bring me most joy in life.
I rather get a flat tire staring up into the stars than to never look above my shoulders.
That is a quote I thought up while biking down a massive hill on the far east side of Madison.

If I had to attempt to look at my situation in an objective way, I would say that being able to impulsive and spontanous is what levels me.
It is also the fuel that ignites real change in my life.
Not saying I will never be in a relationship.
I haven't found the right woman yet.
I am saying that I value my freedom most.
