Every year, the Madison `Hash House Harriers` hosts a tubing event on the Wisconsin river. 
This year they were hosting two nights of camping, grilling, and a float trip.

I took a half day at work on Friday and anticipated about 5 hours of riding to the event at `Traders Camp Ground` in Arena, WI.

A couple of adventurers and myself ventured biked to and from the event.
The GPS said we hit just over 40miles to the campsite since we took a few more backroads and stopped at bars along the way.

The campground was spacious and easily held the 20 so campers that came on Friday. 
There was a lot of games going on such as frisbee, ladder ball, and cards.

# Floating on the Wisconsin
The morning started with some trail running. 
Shortly after buses showed up to escort us to the Tubing start. 
About a dozen or so more people showed up.
We strapped two pony kegs to one of the tubes and we were off for the next 5 hours.
We met another group of people who were like us being silly and drunk.

# The After float
After the float, it was back to the campsite. 
It was definitely an endurance trail drinking during the tubing and still having lots of time in the day.
Some people took naps, others party'd on.
I did what Garth would say I should do.

# Conclussion
I am in love with this event. I was able to run, bike, swim and be silly. 
It is nice being able to have a weekend of no structure and lots of activities.
The cost was relatively cheap too.
