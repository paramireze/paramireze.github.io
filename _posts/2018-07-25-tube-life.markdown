Every year, the Madison `Hash House Harriers` hosts tubing on the Wisconsin river.
This event is especially fun since it is a chance to bike there, drink beer, camp, drink beer, swim, drink beer, trail running, drink beer, and sitting around a campfire drinking beer.

Two years ago, a group of us  biked out halfway to the tubing event at a state park. 
Most the bike riding took place on some military ridge (`rails to trail`) bike path. 

This year, it was rainy and shitty out however three of us were crazy enough to ride. We avoided military ridge since the trail would be mushy from all the rain.
Instead, we rode backroads that had very little traffic the whole way.

This year I biked out with two others. We did not camp in between, however, we made sure to stop every 10 or so miles for a deserved beer break.
About 5 miles from the campsite, we found a trailer yard that had a ranchero vehicle. 
We all jumped in and started to drink away at our beers.
We have a strange fascination with El Camino's and this was the closest thing to one. 

I think about 15 poeple camped out Friday and 25 on Saturday.
Each day we would play frisby, card & board games, drink beer and eventually sit around a camp fire.
Our neighbors sent us a flavorful alcoholic root beer.
In kind, we gave them malort :)
It was four of them and they swore it was the worse thing that they ever drunk.
