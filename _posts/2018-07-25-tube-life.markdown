The camping tent, chair and table all fit easily on my back rack using a bungee cord. 
I went on amazon and bought the equipment that got high rating for being low weight and still quality product.
I was not dissapointed. 
The camping table was surprisingly nice to have.
I used it a lot more than I thought I would.
 
## Friday

I worked a half day so I could get an early start biking out to Traders campground.
It was shitty out and had to travel down roads to avoid the muddy rails to trails path known as military ridge.

Two hasher by the name of OTC and Paging rode the 40 miles there with me.
We stopped about every  10 miles to enjoy a beer and snacks.
The conditions were shitty but our spirits were high.

We rolled in sometime around 6:30pm. The campground was spacious and easily held the 20 so campers that came on Friday. 
There was a lot of games going on such as frisbee, ladder ball, and cards.

There were three different pony kegs and the night was spent playing games and sitting around the camp fire.

## Saturday
# morning
I am a dirty morning person.
Despite drinking lots of booze, I was up about 5:30am.
I biked about 7 miles to a breakfast place called `Break of Dawn` in Spring Green.
I enjoyed their pancakes and coffee while working on iOS development.
When I got back two hours later, people were just getting up and moving. 

# floating on the Wisconsin

The Hash House Harriers did a short trail run and then it was off to the Wisconsin river for tubing.
After loading up two pony kegs, about 30 of us ventured out into the wisconsin river.

We would stop at sandbars and hangout for about half an hour at a time.  periods of time. 

# The After float
After the float, I helped Stiffy get his kayak.
It would not fit on the trailer that carried all the tubes so he got his suburu and I went with him to help.
Otc stayed behidn with the kayak to amke sure no one tampered with it.
Very much a

## Sunday

I did my morning ride to the `break of dawn` restaurant.
I caffeinated and did a bit of reading before getting ready to leave for the day. 
The ride home was much like the ride there except OTC went to Mazo to have bloody's with other hashers.

# Conclussion
I am in love with this event. I was able to run, bike, swim and be silly. 
It is nice being able to have a weekend of no structure and lots of activities.
The cost was relatively cheap too.
