I am all done with the tutorial for preferences and now making applications communicate with an SQLite database. I am two tutorials in and there is a lot of classes and methods being called. I created a diagram of all the players involved.

I feel confident that overtime I will better understand all the moving parts. It look forward trying to claw my way through these tutorials until the moment I go "ah ha!". Until then, I will write about new things that I have not come across before and hope I learn something in the process.

# Cursor
In this tutorial, the exercise has us use a cursor to store a query result set on the waitlist table. I read on stackoverflow that cursor stands for cursory-logic, meaning it will iterate over a result set.

# Context
Context is an interface that allows various resources to communicate with one another. Context stores global information about the application state. That is particularly handy when building new objects, access `SharedPreferences`, and accessing intents. The documentation on `Context` is absolutely insane and I am happy to stop here with this hyper simplified explanation. 


# Abstract Class 
Okay, this is where my lack of Java knowhow starts to become apparaent. According to google,wikipedia and whatever else, an abstract class is a way of providing methods

# RecyclerView.Adapter

# GuestViewHolder class

Inner class to hold the views needed to display a single item in the recycler-view

extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder
