I went to an authentic cuban restaurant in downtown tampa. I ordered their Pallomilla steak with plantanos meduros (ripe banana). The meal came with rice and beans with butter bread. 

In spanish, palomillo means moth or butterfly which describes the look of the thin, evenly split  steak. A traditional steak is marinated in garlic, lime juice, salt and pepper and then pan-fried.
