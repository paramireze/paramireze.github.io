My visit to Tampa has taught me a lot in the ways of spanish cooking. Most meals are served with rice and beans since those are usually grown in most middle american countries. Plantains are a thing. They are large green banana's that I sometimes see in Wisconsin but rarely buy or eat. 

Making good Plantains (Plantanos Meduros) only requires frying them until gold. Some will continue to fry them until they are a darker color. 

It is easy to make your plantains into tostones (toasted). You flatten it with a plate and fry until golden. You then take it out, cool it off in water, and fry each side for one minute.


### Palomilla Steak
From what I read, Palomilla steak is  marinated using lime, salt, pepper, and garlic then pan fried.

### Plantanos Maduros
I also ordered their plantanos maduros. I am fascinated how different the meal tasted.
