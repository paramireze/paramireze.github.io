I had an interesting flight to Tampa. United had to delay my flight two hours because they were waiting for food to arrive for catering. I am guessing there must be some regulation that flights are not allowed to not have food when flying or something because having a full 737 wait two hours so I can eat a bag of pretzels is weird. 

When the plane finally did land, some of the passengers were clapping and cheering, with all the frustration that must come when being delayed.

My cousin found me waiting outside the united entrance to the airport and scoped me up. The plan was for us to eat at a restaurant. My cousin recommended Bahama Breeze which was reportedly fantastic food, however, everyone and their moms was trying to get a seat. Instead, we continued onward to an authentic Cuban restaurant instead.

I ordered their steak, rice, beans, and plantains dishes. I was especially hungry after traveling for an extra two hours and was happy to see how much steak was served with my meal, especially considering the menu is fairly inexpensive. I was also surprised how savory the plantains were. They must have fried it because they looked closer to chicken than it did to a plant.

## The Beach is happening
I slept well Saturday night. The room had thick curtains that blocked out all light and the bed was firm and not too soft. I started the day with a morning jog around the gated community. I was greeted by a neighbor walking her dog. The morning was beautiful. It has been a while since I have seen so many tropical trees and plants and spent a quite a bit of time studying the foreign plant life. 

The lawns their use St. Augustine grass which is a super thick, carpet like grass that is good at blocking out weeds. I guess that type of grass takes a lot of water for it to thrive and requires some maintenance.

I got to meet my cousins husband that morning. He works at the fire department and finished a 24 hour shift for Pinella county or St. Pete's.  He got back from the gym and made himself a smoothy using spinach, avocado, and i forget what else. He makes a fantastic coffee called bullet proof coffee using coconut oil and organic butter. 

My cousin made us a frittata using brocoli, onion, tomato, basil leaves, and egg. She used a cast iron skillet on the stove top until the egg solidified. She then put the skillet in the oven until finished.

Once fed, caffeinated and ready, we headed over to Caddy's on the beach. We drove over the incredible skybridget that allowed people that connected both ends of the harbor. Driving over it can be a bit terrifying since the lanes aren't too wide. There is also quite a bit of elevation. 

It was a bit difficult finding parking and some lady tried to turn into us while crossing an intersection. We got lucky and found someone leaving in a parking lot near the beach. My cousin was not taking chances and got out to make sure no one tried to the steal our score.
