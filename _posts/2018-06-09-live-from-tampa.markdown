My visit to Tampa has taught me a lot in the ways of spanish cooking. Most meals are served with rice and beans since those are usually grown in most middle american countries. Plantains are a thing. They are large green banana's that I sometimes see in Wisconsin but rarely buy or eat. 


## Arepas
Arepas is a corn based dough shaped into a thick pancake. They make for a good choice if you are looking for a gluten free. You are able have your arepa stuff with  meat, cheese, and/or veggies. Arepa's are popular in Venezuela and Columbiaand are often sold on the streets.

## Cachapa
I ordered a Cachapa at Nico's food cart and was told that cachapa is just like an arepa except there is sugar added. Also, Arepas are made using a precooked, ground corn flour where as a cachapa uses fresh corn and cornmeal.

## Palomilla Steak
From what I read, Palomilla steak is  marinated using lime, salt, pepper, and garlic then pan fried.

## Plantanos Maduros
I also ordered their plantanos maduros. I am fascinated how different the meal tasted. 

Making good Plantains (Plantanos Meduros) only requires frying them until gold. Some will continue to fry them until they are a darker color. It is easy to make your plantains into tostones (toasted). You flatten it with a plate and fry until golden. You then take it out, cool it off in water, and fry each side for one minute.
