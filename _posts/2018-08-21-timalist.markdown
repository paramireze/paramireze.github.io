If I had to categorize myself in some generalized way, I would call myself a `Timalist`.
When racing in a triathlon, there are generally two transitions that take place.
Those are times when you transition from the swim into the bike or the bike to the run.
It is a big advantage to be able to quickly transition.

In the same sense, that is how I handle every day activities.
When I wake up in the morning, I am usually out the door under 10 minutes. 
When I get home from work, I quickly change, drop off my work clothes and out the door to whatever other thing I am doing.
Finding ways to simplify those little, everyday tasks is a huge key for being motivated.
