I am getting older.
In the past few years, I have grown up a lot.
I am good at handling stressful situations and focusing on boring tasks for extended periods of time.
That is what makes me good at my job. 
However, I am not that good when it comes to relationships.
All those skills I am learning is not helping me in my personal life.
Sure, I am doing okay and people generally like me. 
However, I am distant.

There was a time when people could reliably get to me.
It wasn't a bad thing, it kept me connected to people. 
Now, I am pretty good at walling myself off from people. 
I see their attempts of communication for what it is.

There was a time when i cared about what people thought.
It was easy for them to comment on something about me that I might not like and I would instantly react.
That is no longer the case for the most part.
I am comfortable with long silences.
I am more comfortable yet with critisism in regards to my deamoner such as "you look tired" or "you're qui".
Those words use to rile me up and make me swear that I was in no such condition.

I think these changes are good.
I feel alone now and like things are far less predicatable.
That to me is a realistic way of seeing things. 
This life could end.
What is the point of pretending to being anything other than what I am feeling even if it is deemed socially unacceptable.
