I have a ruby rails project and have a bit of a challenge to take on. I am querying a databaes for a list of reports. The query populates an array of reports which I iterate over and display on the view. The problem I am having is, in each report there is formatting to indicate a new line. For example, if the word `SUBJECT:` is in the reports, it should go on a new line. But how the heck do I do that? 
When I was in college, I had a regular expression class and I was a borderline not an amatuer. I don't remember any of that stuff now. I hate to study up on my reg ex and only use it this once and never touch the stuff again. ... hmm now that I think of it, that is a good problem to have ;)
