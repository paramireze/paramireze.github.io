I am building a new application for work using ruby rails. The project requires that I use an already existing database. This is the first time i have had to do this. The application I am building is primarily a data driven website using the existing databases's information. That means I will not be designing and creating models for the ORM. I find myself a bit surprised how different it is to develop this way. I have almost exclusively done domain/model-driven-development which means I spend a large amount of time putting upfront thought into my applications database and designing the models. For this project, it is the opposite. I am going straight into coding since i already have all the database decisions already made for me. I find this experience to be unorthodox in a fun way. It is forcing me to solve new problems that I would have never thought about.
