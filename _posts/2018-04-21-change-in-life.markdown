Last January, I decided to learn mobile development. At first with android and then iOS. My daily habits have changed quite a bit since taking on my new hobby. For one, I drink a lot less alcohol. I now enjoy my weekends in the presence of pandora, my macbook, a quiet coffee shop and a end of night celebration beer. 

I have also have noticed that my sleep schedule is a lot different. I am now a fithy morning person. It is a chance to spend a solid 1-2 hours learning at my own pace without any pressure from work. Just me exploring my way through tutorials learning something new.  

I am not in the gym nearly as much. I eat right and do strength training, however, I am not putting in the long hours I once did working on buiding strength and endurance.
