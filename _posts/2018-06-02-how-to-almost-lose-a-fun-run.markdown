Well, I am not sure how I won the fun run 5k race at SIIM this year. I managed to miss the turnaround and run an extra 100m. I guess the second and third place must have felt sorry for me and waited waited for me to come back. Luckily all my time running through the winter paid off. I was able to run the extra distance and still stay ahead of the others. I took home the gold and the `crowd goes wild`
