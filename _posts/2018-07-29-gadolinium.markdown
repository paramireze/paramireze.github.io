I have finished with the apple's development tutorial for iOS using swift. 
It is now time that I venture off into the wild and try to build things.
My first application will be pro bono project for the radiology department. 
They are looking to update an existing application called the Gadolinium Calculator
 
The existing app was built in object c and thought it best to build the application from scratch using swift.
I have never developed in object c, however, I was told that swift provides a lot of benefits that makes starting over worth it.
