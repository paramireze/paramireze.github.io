In my old age of 38, I have discovered that you need not go far to explore.

# Lake shore path -> picnic point -> eagle heights
Madison has some good trails along the lakes ripe for running.

# Union south
I watch the star wars chase seen through the forest. 
That is when where the ewoks are introduced into the movie series.
