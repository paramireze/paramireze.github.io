Hello world,

How is everyone? I am well except I feel like I am getting my ass kicked by the latest lesson trying to set up a basic activity, layout and menu item. Here I am delving deep into LoaderManagers thinking I am becoming an expert.

In this lesson, I learned that there are two steps to adding a menu item. 1) you need to override the `onCreateOptionsMenu()`. 2) use `MenuInflater` to convert the menu from xml to a java object. This takes place inside the activity class. 

Told you this was back to the basics. No fancy diagrams or big code blocks. Familiarity is king when it comes to learning a new language and the most basic concepts are equally important as the more advanced.
