This year I will be visiting my good friend `Stephen Wasmund` in his home town `Salt Lake City, Utah`. He lives with his wife and her family. He was once living in `Madison` until he found a job position at the local university there. 

Our plan now is to do the `Big Potato` 80 mile gravel ride event at `Rebecca's Private Idaho Ride`.

Rebecca Rusch is the “queen of pain” with a heart of gold. 
As a professional athlete for more than three decades, the seven-time world 
champion has continually tested her own limits. Rebecca has redefined the 
team dynamics of adventure racing, has achieved a first female ascent rock climbing 
El Capitan in Yosemite, river boarded down the Grand Canyon, pedaled through 
the night on an epic adventure across Italy, ridden to the summit of Africa’s legendary 
Mt. Kilimanjaro, and taught clinics and camps in her #JoinTheRusch effort to introduce 
more women to her sport. Rebecca is also the bestselling author of Rusch to 
Glory, event producer for Rebecca’s Private Idaho, a motivational speaker, 
a firefighter, and a cycling advocate. She has raised more than 
$100,000 for bike-related charities through her adventures and events. This summer, 
a Red Bull Media House feature film called Blood Road documented her personal journey along 
the 1,200-mile Ho Chi Minh Trail in search of her father. Click here to learn more about Rebecca 
and her efforts on behalf of Mines Advisory Group. American Consequences
