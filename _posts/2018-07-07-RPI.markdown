This year I will be visiting my good friend `Stephen Wasmund` in his home town `Salt Lake City, Utah`. He lives with his wife and her family. He was once living in `Madison` until he found a job position at the local university there. 

Our plan now is to do the `Big Potato` 80 mile gravel ride event at `Rebecca's Private Idaho Ride`. 

## Rebecca's Private Ride - Big Potato Ride

The `Big Potato` bike route is a 94 mile, gravel and paved roads route in Idaho's mountainous terrain.
