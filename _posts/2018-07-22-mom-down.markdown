My mom has `Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy`.
It is a condition in which a protein will clump together and form fibrils.
The MRI showed `Amyloids` buildup in the back of her brain.
As a result, she has swelling and severe migraines.

The attending [Michael Ward]({{ 'https://www.uwhealth.org/findadoctor/profile/michael-a-ward-md/10570' }}) updated me on her condition.

## A Personal Reflection

when I first found out my mom was in the hospital, I was frustrated that I would be giving up my evening.
I thought how I can not leave her for one minute without her getting ill.
As i sit here now, the next morning after those thoughts make no since to me.
I spent the night here and she would wake up crying from her intense migraines.



## A Shout Out
I woke up to my mom crying for help. She had a migraine and her pain medication was wearing off.
`Roxy` the nurse assistant came in and comforted her. She hugged her and told her she will be okay.
SHe got her medication and tucked her into bed. Thank you Roxy.
