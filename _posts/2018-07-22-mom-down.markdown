My mom has `Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy`.
It is a condition in which a protein will clump together and form fibrils.
The MRI showed `Amyloids` buildup in the back of her brain.
As a result, she has swelling and severe migraines.

The attending [Michael Ward]({{ 'https://www.uwhealth.org/findadoctor/profile/michael-a-ward-md/10570' }}) updated me on her condition.



## A Personal Reflection

when I first found out my mom was in the hospital, I was frustrated that I would be giving up my evening.
I thought how I can not leave her for one minute without her getting ill.
As i sit here now, the next morning after those thoughts make no since to me.
I spent the night here and she would wake up crying from her intense migraines.



## A Shout Out
I woke up to my mom crying for help. She had a migraine and her pain medication was wearing off.
`Roxy` the nurse assistant came in and comforted her. She hugged her and told her she will be okay.
SHe got her medication and tucked her into bed. Thank you Roxy.

## Monday night
I noticed that I was acting impulsively. I was compulsively eating and did not know why. I decided to go home and spend some time for myself.
It proved to be a well needed break. I was able to get in a workout and make some food. I was still
compulsively eating. I came back to the hospital and noticed it was impossible for me to focus on anything.
I was reacting to something and wasn't sure what. I could tell through my inability to focus and relax that
something else was happening. I put in a movie and my mom nearly jumped out of bed. She started to beg for a cigarette
and then whimper. I offered to help but continued to watch my movie. For the first time today
she wanted food and started telling me she is in a lot of pain. I think I was picking up on her sense of frustration and pain.
She is forceful now. She has to let me know she feels terrible. She reminds me of someone who is drowning. The pain is taking over her thoughts.
Her addiction tearing at her convictions. She is faced with a terrible pain that makes me think is the source of many of her problems.
she is hurting now. i forgot she
