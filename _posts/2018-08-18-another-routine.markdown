I find that sit-ups and regular planks are boring. 
To stay strong and motivated, I incorporated a few core workouts into my regular routine that I think are fun.

# Turkish Get ups

Getting off the floor can be a surprisingly good workout. 
You are working abs, legs, and shoulder and you look like a stud in the gym while doing them.
For best results, I like to slow things down quite a bit so I am bracing my core for longer

# dumbbell pushups & arm raise

I always feel like a bad ass while doing these. 
No doubt it has to be one of the best core workouts out there.


# single arm snatch

Not so much core as it is legs and lower back. Perhaps lowerback counts as core.
These are fun exercises that help me stay motivated when feeling like my workouts are stagnating.
