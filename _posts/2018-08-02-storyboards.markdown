I had a lot of trouble getting things to line up the way I wanted to. 
I couldn't figure out how to make my text labels multilined without readjusting all the stackviews.
I couldn't figure out how to get the switch button to display and have it align center.
I am not sure if there is something I am not understanding or if the storyboards are just have limitations.

I read an article about designing the interface without storyboards. My plan is to completely write the UI programmatically.
