Building this app is one of the most rewarding experiences I have ever had in my life.
It took a lot of work for me to learn and be comfortable with `swift/xcode`.

## A different mindset
Mobile development forces you to be a front end designer as well as a server side programmer.
When developing desktop applications, I like to think I am more conscious of design and layout than most.
However, mobile development taught me that I do not spend nearly enough time thinking about design.

## How do things communicate?
One of the biggest challenges for me was learning how the different view controllers communicate with one another. 
It is a lot different than the traditional web requests that is typical of desktop application development.

## Strong Type Programming Language
I do a lot of programming using ruby and php which are both loosely typed languages.
Swift is freaking awesome at ensuring things are exactly what they are supposed to be.
I can see now why people may not like scripting/weak type languages such as php. 
However, I am not one of those people.
I believe good programming conventions can make code highly dependable regardless of the language.
Albeit, I might be more hesitant to approach code written in a weak typed language if I think it was developed by someone who is not familiar with best practices.
