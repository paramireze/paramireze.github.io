Hello World. This is where I like to go to put my thoughts out there. I cover coding, life experiences, and strategies for learning new things. I am an avid endurance junkie and will often nerd out about fitness. If you don't mind all those things, welcome to my blog.

Far as being a software developer, my philosophy has changed a lot since taken on a senior role within the IT team. I no longer identify my development philosophy based on the code I write, albiet I do a lot of it. Instead, I try encouraging best practices and adhere industry standard process.
