Hello World. This is where I like to go to put my thoughts out there. I cover coding, life experiences, and strategies for learning new things. I am an avid endurance junkie and will often nerd out about fitness. If you don't mind all those things, welcome to my blog.

Far as being a software developer, my philosophy has changes depending on the role I play within the team. In the back of my mind, I strive for best practices and feel the pain when shortcuts are made. However, the best software is the software in someone's hands. For that reason, I think communication is the key to a healthy software development process.
