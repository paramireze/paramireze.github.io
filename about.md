## Paul Ramirez - Ruby Rails Developer

As the title suggests, this is where I go to learn. My goal is to help retain the things I learned from tutorials and project work by creating posts discussing each lesson. I have found that the process of writing posts forces me to organize my thoughts so I can word it in a way that would make sense to someone else. It also helps me identify areas in which I am weak in just from not being able to easily write about a given subject. 

These posts are usually thought spaghetti and not meant to be structured for any formal educational material.
