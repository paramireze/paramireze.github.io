How I became an `Original Gangster`  

- I sold my car
- Ditched my smart phone
- Deleted all social media accounts
- Get rid of internet all together at home
- Hug my mom every chance I get and make her yummy food
- Be in the gym 5am every morning
- Hang out with friends and be silly, preferably with beer
- Schedule 1-2 hours everyday to develop dope software
