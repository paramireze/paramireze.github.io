You found me, welcome to my site! This is a place where I go to organize my thoughts on subjects I have learned. My posts are meant to be an informal summerization of tutorials and lessons I have learned from educational videos and/or work. 

You are welcome to join in on my journey to learning new things. I jump around a lot so sorry in advanced for the subject whiplash. 

## todo list:
1. add categories to sort posts
2. tag each post with keywords that can be further sorted
