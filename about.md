How I became an `Original Gangster`  

- I sold my car and ran/bike commuted
- skipped my smart phone in a nearby lake and bought a flip. An iPhone skips about 8 times last time i checked ;)
- deleted my facebook, twitter, and instagram accounts
- stop paying charter for internet and bought a few books instead
- I give my mom a hug almost everyday and make her yummy food
- I am in the gym at 5am every morning 
- Hang out with friends and be silly, preferably with beer
