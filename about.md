How I became an `Original Gangster`  

- sell your car & run/bike every chance you get
- skip your smart phone in a nearby lake and buy a flip. An iPhone skips about 8 times last time i checked ;)
- delete your facebook, twitter, and instagram accounts
- stop paying charter for internet and buy books instead
- give your mom lots of hugs and make her yummy food
- be in the gym at 5am every morning you can
- be silly and hang out with friends, preferably with beer
