Thank you for visiting my blog, it is a place where I go to discuss nerdy stuff.
I am an ordinary guy who lives the good life. 
My time is mostly spent pursuing athletics and writing code.
Otherwise, I like to cook my mom meals and hang out with friends.
Most recently, I have taken up reading the `Malazan series` by Stephen Erikson.
