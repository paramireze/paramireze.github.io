How I became an `Original Gangster`  

- I sold my car and now ran & bike commute everyday.
- skipped my smart phone in a nearby lake and bought a flip. An iPhone skips about 8 times last time i checked ;)
- deleted my facebook, twitter, and instagram accounts
- stop paying charter for internet and schedule time in my day to use internet at the library.
- I give my mom a hug every chance I get make her yummy food
- I am in the gym at 5am every morning
- Hang out with friends and be silly, preferably with beer
- Fell deeply in love with writing and learning software languages and frameworks
